The work of Professor Zrenner on subretinal implants has shown that increasing the number and density of electrodes is a complex objective. The [electrode](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/electrodes) distribution, the implant design and new materials have to be considered for improving further the resolution of individual electrodes. A model study has thus investigated how the electrode distribution could affect the current distribution. Three different configurations were examined: a distant common ground, a bipolar stimulation between a central and an annular return electrode, and a ground grid surrounding all stimulating electrodes [[39]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0195). If the concentric electrodes were improving the current spread, it doubled the number of wires in the foil, complicating thereby the device. Ground grids could further limit the current spread, provided this grid has low impedance. As a consequence, we have introduced such ground grid in our recent retinal implant model [[40]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0200). Prof. Palanker similarly inserted such a ground grid in his autonomous photodiode array [[41]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0205), [[42]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0210). In this device, each electrode is connected to three photodiodes in series and light is projected on the implant in the infrared to reach light intensities that are sufficient to generate enough current for activation of the retinal cells. The advantage of this design would be to remove the power supply or battery, which complicates the surgery to establish the wire connection. However, goggles would be required to transform visual scenes into infrared stimulations of the implant.
