“The very first impression drawn from the extensive review of the literature was the considerable difficulty in finding a consensus in the definition of “mental workload”.

This author points out that it can be characterized as a mental construction that reflects the “mental tension” resulting from the execution of a task under specific environmental and operational conditions, associated with the operator’s ability to respond to these demands.”

“To this day, technostress has become a serious problem for IT users and other professionals due to its potential negative effect on users’ mental capacity [59]. This concept has raised interest among the scholars, as it also falls under the notion that everything, including technology, has a dark side [48].”
