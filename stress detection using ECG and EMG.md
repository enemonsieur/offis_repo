The state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) [25] questionnaire was utilized to measure the self-reported stress of participants. The state anxiety scale (STAI-Y1) is the momentâ€™s undesirable feelings of stress that are consciously perceived and are associated with the arousal of the ANS.

Although many questionnaires have been proposed for measuring stress, the STAI is one of the most popular tools for measuring state-trait anxiety that has been used in many stress-related studies
