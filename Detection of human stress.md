Previously, in emotion research, ECG signals of 0100 Hz and 010 Hz were considered in assessing the states.31,32 ECG signals of 010 Hz were separated into eight equally spaced sub-bands with nonoverlapping intervals to obtain a maximum mean classification accuracy of 75%[[[...] ]
the maximum mean classification rate of 79% and 76% is achieved using the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers on distinguishing stress and the emotional states of a car driver through ECG signal of 0-100 Hz. Usually, in HRV, the range 0-0.5 Hz is considered to analyze the stress due to the ANS and stress relationships.
