The NASA-TLX utilizes a visual analogue scale to depict six independent sub-scales that measure cognitive workload: Mental, Physical and Temporal Demands, Own Performance, Effort and Frustration (see Fig. 1). The premise is that these dimensions represent the “workload” experienced by workers; the dimensions reflect theories equating workload with the magnitude of the demands relative to the resources of the worker.
