If the subjects could not complete editing the page of text, they were verbally prompted to use the ‘‘page down’’ key on the keyboard and continue with the text-editing task ont he next page. Subjects were also verbally provoked every 15th s (e.g. ‘‘hurry up’’ or ‘‘come on, you can do it faster’’). The verbal provocationwas givenby the same test leader throughout the experiment (JS)
