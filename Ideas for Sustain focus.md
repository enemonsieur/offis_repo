If you still find it hard to focus despite all the attempts to ward off distractions, you might want to consider adjusting your work hours to your [circadian rhythm](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx). 

Depending on whether you find it more natural to do your best work in the morning or you feel more productive at night, you can pick your extreme time slots and tailor your workday according to your Biological Prime Time.

Noise is one of the main problems when it comes to breaking your focus. When you find yourself in an environment which is either too loud or too quiet, any sudden noise will distract you and break your focus. You can solve this by listening to [background sounds](https://www.noisli.com/), which create a constant, pleasant and inspiring sound environment while at the same time masking any potential disturbing noises.

Especially the movement (**e.g. playing basketball or jogging after work in nature**) is what stimulates your brain activity and increases your ability to concentrate. At the same time, it provides a pleasant balance after long periods of concentration and increases your resistance to stress

- How to use every single time of your day to do some work: ### — Use commute time well
- Your one-way 1-hour [commute time](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/everything-about-commute/) doesn’t have to be a curse. Think of it as some extra time you can spend cutting down the long hours you’d spend working in the office or at home.

There are plenty of ways you can go about it:

-   **Record your thoughts** — you can use Alexa or Google Voice to compile your to-do list for today, or simply brainstorm ideas and record notes that will help you organize your work better later that day. 
-   **Take that power nap** — if you manage to pull off at least 20 minutes of sleep in your commute, you’re on an excellent start to feel fully refreshed when you arrive at the office.
-   **Think about what you still have to finish** — on your way home, you can reflect on what you did at the office, and what you still have to finish when you get home.
-   **Catch up on your emails** — if you travel by public transportation, you can use commute time to read and reply to emails.
-   **Make phone calls** — if you have a phone call scheduled during the day, why not make it in the car or bus?
**- When to ask for tutors to build commitment.**
