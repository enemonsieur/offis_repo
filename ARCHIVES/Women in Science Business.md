ystery of nuclear fission. In 1944, Otto Hahn became thesole winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery. There was no mention of Lise Meitner. It wasnot until 1992 that German physicists fused isotopes of iron and bismuth to create the heaviest artificialelement then known. They named it “meitnerium” in honor of this forgotten scientist.Hélène Langevin-Joliot says,In  discovering  artificial  radioactivity  my  parents  did  exactly  what  my  grandmother  had  done  but  inreverse. In each case, they created a situation in which the science had to be rethought. Marie upset theapple cart by finding radioactivity and then Irène did the same thing by finding atomic fission, only shedidn’t know what she had done. Theoretically it could not exist
