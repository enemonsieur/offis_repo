The central question to elucidate is: What keeps Retinal Prosthetics from working

1. Why aren't they as good as chochlear implant. 
2. What makes it challenging to build them
3. What are the different approaches that exist to build them

What problem do retinal implants solve? (show the eye, and show the pieces where they can be destroyed)
1. AMD
2. RP
- Those diseases don't apply to a very big percentage of the population so don't really help a lot of people
- Only 200 patients for the Argus for example
- But people have been 
- Talk about how vision works: Receptive Field activation, need excitatory and inhibitory signals. 
Vision is the most important of our senses. People say it may take up to 80% of our perception and indeed, most of the studies on sensory modality have been done of vision. 
Look at the auditory diagram. If there's [700K cochlear implants ](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants#:~:text=Children%20and%20adults%20who%20are,adults%20and%2065%2C000%20in%20children.)wordlwide, just imagine how much retinal implants exists to cure people with no vision!: Do a fake diagram comparing CI andRI: 50000 RI. Only 50K implants... sorry. Wait what? That can be so low... Oh. Sorry . I actually mixed the slides. Here's the real number... [500 patients in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198351/#:~:text=There%20have%20now%20been%20three,over%20the%20past%2015%20years.) 2020 . 1% of the CI have been installed worldwide. 
How could there be such a discrepancy between the obsession with vision and the visual technology? 

What do you think? Any idea? (questionnaire)
Well,as always in science, its complicated. 

So there's two way of explaining this: The boring way and the cool way. With the boring way we'll go through each steps of the creation of retinal prosthetics from ground up. With the cool way we'll  see how we could create our own retinal prosthetic on our own! 
So, what do you choose? Boring? Cool?

Well, I choosed the cool way, bc I want you guys to  have at least a good grasp on Retinal Implants!
# How do vision work
Before understanding how Retinal prothesis can recreate vision, let's look at how vision works. What are the important parts of it, and what exactly can go wrong in it to justify the 200K euros cost of our Retinal P. 
Vision starts by the cornea, goes through the lense and then hit the retina layer, where there's the photo receptors, Cones and rods. Then, those transduce the photons/lights into signal, that move to the bipolar cell, in the next layer, who then moves it to the RGCs, our target region. 
- Questions: What happen to the membrane of the PhotoR? Gets hyperpolarized, which removes Glutamate, making the pigment (iodopsin or rhodopsin,) change conformation, which reduces the cGMP concentration, a well knowed 2nd messenge,  --> no entering of Na then hyperpolarization, that stop the release of Glu NT, and this will actually  excited the bipolar cells
- You know may be the PReceptors, rodes and cones and how the transducte the signal
> Why would we go through the pain of transducting the signal ourselves instead of having a photoreceptors prosthetics? (In CI, we stimulate the transductors)
- 
The RGCs then move the signal to the Optic nerve, Moves to the Optic tract, reaches the Lateral Geniticulated Nucleus, That projects to the Occipital cortex, 1°Visual Cortex. 

So. Now, Remember, the point is to bring back vision. But there's  not a single cause of blindness. And depending on the part of the visual system that's broken, we can have a lot of causes. 
So let's play a game: I'm gonna align different diseases, and you'll try to guess where the lesion happenned. 
[ Any ideas?](https://www.brightfocus.org/macular/article/eye-diseases-can-cause-legal-blindness)
- Cataract lenses.
- Strokes
- Glaucoma -retinal die.
- age-related macular degeneration
-   retinitis pigmentosa
-   diabetic retinopathy
- -   Optic neuritis, an inflammation (swelling) of the optic nerve caused by [multiple sclerosis.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/multiple-sclerosis)
Match them to the parts of the brain.

AMD: Destroy of the macula the specialized central part of the retina
Retinitis Pigmentosa: Rare genetic diseases

So, these two last are particularly interesting because they directly screw the retinal cells, and stimulation from other regions can't help. 
(How is it simlar to chochlea? Loosing hearing will also deteriorate your inner cells, that transduct and convey sounds )

### Why did we choose Retinal Mostly?
That's where RP comes into play, because they will stimulate directly the RP. Not the part where there's signal transduction (the photoreceptors), but really just before the optic nerve
- advantage obvious: 125 M PRCs for 1.5 RGCs.
- different from Cochlear Implant. 
Retinal prosthesis will try to stimulate the remaining retinal ganglion, just like CI, and restore, "some kind" of vision to the subjects (INSERT STORY OF PHOSPHENES) and those phosphenes can significantly restore the vision of patient. 

Ok. Let's wrap it up. Most of the diseases out there involve more or less the retina, so it'd make sense to stimulate it. Right? Wrong. 
Because every part that's beyond the Retina, is also stimulatable. Actually, since a part of the RGCs get destroyed due to the diseases, it'd make sense to stimulate EVERYTING beyond the retina. So why is most of the research focusing on the retina? Good question. Let's talk about it: 

Let's go from the retina, step by step, to test every possibilty. After the retina we have the optic nerve. 
OPTIC NERVE: Study show that by variating the pulse duration, frequency applied to the ON, we can elicit phosphenes at different localtions. Since we directly stimulate the nerve, we don't need that much current so double win! 
But wait. There's some obvious drawback: Very small nerve[  1-μm diameter optic nerve fibers](([Jonas et al., 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B74))
Then let's go to the next stop: 
The Lateral Geniculate Nucleaus (LGN): It's situated after the optic chiasm, and  would be coon for patient that have an issue with their nerve. But the drawback is -> Surgical intense
CORTEX: 
Good: When injuries in LGN OPTic nerve, Retina. Because the Cortical Map of the Cortex is well known, it'd be easier to stimulate the right regions to have the same image, 
Bad:  Almost everything else: Need too much electrode, transmitting the signal, also there are convolutions in the brain, hard to touch by the electrode. This is Elon Musk- Neural Link 

How can we go further. As a species. What are other crazier way to do that?

- Optogenetics: Add viral vectors, encode Opsins in tissues like Retina. Apply light with an LED matrice and stimulate the retina
Problem: Ethics
- Magentic Stimulation: Using it to stimulate neurons at a specific region. Non invasive, some [studies](([Bonmassar et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B14)) Show its possible in vitro 
Problem: Advance in material science -> Biocompatible polymers (induction), Coils usualy not power efficient, lack of heat dissipation
NEXT: SPiderman
- Nanoparticule based Stimulation: Currently used to deliver drugs, Combination with Magnetic gradient  -> Guiding the NanooP to act on membrane channel ex: V1 neurons. 
Problem:  How to deliver in the CNS (blod brain), LT effects, 
- Sensory Substitution: Synesthesia
Take grid of phosphenses, put in on tactil or auditory;  
Tactile -> Limiting reading capabilities
Help with strokes, destroy of brain cells.

Great ! Awesome. So as we can see, even if there are more reliable places to stimulate the brain, the technology is simply not following yet. This is why currently the RP are the most used prothesis. 

So, we decided to stimulate the retina directly which is smart becaus qe are not risking our patients life. - surgery safer in retinal - Now let's try to see what challenges we need to overcome to do so. 

As I explain before, the retinal layer is made of many sub-layer. The outer layer, where light from the lense hit, is the photoreceptor-layer. Then light is transducted to the bipolar, then RGCs. As I said, there's a lot of signal processing happening there: 
1. Most of the photoreceptors are contained in the central part, but less in the periphery
2. Many PR are smaller and more compact in the middle part rather than the periphery,
3. - So, at the macular (middle) 1:1:1 ratio, but a looot more when we get away. 
4. and 1000 of PR combine to stimulase the RCGs
5. The RGCs are further subdived into ON and OFF cells, that depending on the light stimuli in the eyes, can actually be activated or deactivated
6. Further, a lot of modulation also arise from amacrine and other cells
In the end, the signal that reaches the RP has little to do with the original light signal in intensity or color. 
7. Retinotrophy changes (some studies says no other yes)

One of the way of stimulating that is to stimulate direclty from the cells in the subretinal here(point) like the bipolar cells, before there's this signal processing. But because they are deeper in the eyes, they could damage the retina, and also don't dissipate heat enough.


So how do we solve the problem of having so much RCGs? Think about solultions #retinalcochlea 
Because by stimulating just some parts of the RP, we can obtain a roughly good enough image, to restore some kind of vision. Because of all oof the problems cited here, the resulting vision will really be poor. But may be, usuable. 

Let's say we have this image. We know what is it. But Joe doesn'T. How can we help Joe regain some sense of the image? We need couple of technologies to do so right? Can you think of the first thing we need to turn this into neural input?
*Or, show a turned image, and ask people to guess and do the reverse, turn it back into true image? Too complicated. *
1. Of course the first thing is to turn that light brigthness and intensity and color into electrical signal. (Color is out. No PRcs) There are two strategies to do so. You could use the 

ARGUS:
(Ask the guys what we need)
Directly capture the image, and turn it into signals. For that you need 3 things: 
	1. A glass mounted computer, A portable computer (Visual Processing Unit, VPU) that turns the image into electrical stimuli. An external coil that will transmit the signal by RF to the internal parts.
	2. Then in the internal parts, we have an internal coil that will reviec the RF into and convert in back in electrical power. Then, There'S this ASIC Application-Specific-Integrated-Circuit (ASIC that will generate the appropriate electrical pulses based on the recieved datta
	3- And finally the most imprtant, the micro electrode. 
Of course, there are other ways to do so, and the other one is the The alpha-IMS. It as:
- More electrodes (1500)
- But most importnatnly it relyins on photodiodes, that are direcly placed in the eyes and measure the light and turn it into current. 
So IYO, what will be the difference of intra-versus extra occulary device?
- no correcting the movement
- But hard to process the signal like changing the stimulation pattern because the photodiods directly convert the signal - Can't independently stimulate the electrodes. 

the most succesful? 

Well, noone of them are. They both give the same results, even by using different techniques Which is weird right? I mean AIMS has 1500 electrodes. Tha's more than 20 more than Argus!

May be we'll find an explanation by going deeper in the electrodes. Now that we have this signal turn into electric, we have to find where to place those electrodes, and how they make the retinal cells react. 
## MicroElectrodes Stimulations
THere are many factors to consider when stimulating the retina. If you look at the diagram (=), you'll see that there's a lot of layer in the eyes. So depending on where you place the electrode array, you ll be able to stimulate a certain type of cells. If you put it  before the retina, at the level of the degenerated PRcs, y[ou can may be stimulated then, and avoid the burden of processing the signal,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6350159/), but at the same time, you need to go deeper in the eye, and its an unfamiliar procedure for surgeon. Also most of the diseases destroy the PRs
If you go directly on the retina, it's better because you'll stimulate the bipolar cells. You'll loose some signal processing, yeah, but it's a much safer procedure. 

Ok. The electrode is placed. Now what?  Applying the current? But what's the number one danger of current?
According to [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub)  the charge limit has been settle to 0.35 mC/cm2 . (But turns out, for platinum grid like Argus,, it can be raised to 1mc/cm^2 @stronksFunctionalPerformanceArgus2014) So what ever we do, we must not cross this for too long at least. But you all know that the flow of current varies with the proximity to the source. We've seen the equation in CI. Applying a current can result in a monstruosly high charge, if the electrodes is too close from the tissue! 

So the next factor of interest would be the amplitude. How would the amplitude of the electrodes affects the vision/phosphenes?
- Brightness
- Size
Because you have to remember phosphes are just big round pixels, and our image is actually pretty low. Like playing a gameboy/ Game like Pacman They can be big or small, brighter or darker. THis is all you can get from RP. No color, no precized view. Just like the woman()

[This  study show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/) that the threshold to even witness a phosphene, when the electrodes are properly place correspond to a current of 173-902 uA or little bit below 1mA (CI was around 1.3mA). 
A[s this study shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/),the brightness increases gradually from 1  to 7 times the threshold stimuli -> As measure by patients
But then, we remember amplitude isn'T the only thing we modulate.
Frequencies : 20 to 120Hz gives gradual increase in brightness but NOT in size
This is important because we have different ways to represent phosphenes for patients. We don't have to just modulate the intensity and change the frequencies according to how the image we see change, but we can also change the frequencies to make objects appear brighter. 


Now we have to be able to transduct that signal into vision right? In the eyes, This is called to phosphenes or seeing dots with the eyes because of stimulation. 
How do we create phosphenes? Well, simple. We have to increase progressively our current, until a bit before the max charge, and see if the patient report seeing any ligh points. 


And may be you're already seeing where I wanna go hehe. Now that we know what are the modalities that affects the phosphenes, the pixels patients see, we can model the algorithm that's going to turn the images, into stimmuli and predict what the patients are going to see. Many models like that exis, but let's focus on one of them: The perceptual sensitivity model by[ the study here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub) Which predicts how different puls trains will results in different brighness
As you can see, 
- The first BOX will spreak the stimulus in the space around the electorde
- The second will use a low pass filter, using a time constant to predict the accumulation of charge overtime
- The third willt ake this charge and convolve it to a gamma function, then half-rectifyit (very similar to CI model). This gives us the amplitude and frequency responsible for a brightness level.
- The 4 will use a power non-linearity and a sigmoidal fxn 
- This willbe usein 5th to convolve with a LP filter with a 3stage gamma function and give us the brightness response. 
With this type of model, we can predict the phosphenes, and compare it to what the cpatitents have witness, and iterate again and again to improve our predictions!


Great! Now that we have a functioning Retinal Prosthetics. Let's see what it can do! [As this study measured](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090), we usually use biphasic pulse, around 0.45ms/phase at 20hz which is consistent with previous datas.
As you can tell from the bike image, the data are filter, and appear as a lot of dots, that can be seen by the patients. You can se the dots have diferent brightness and size, which is exactly what we figured out!

Argus -> Need to stay still and scan the surrounding. 
*Flicker fusion in Argus 16 subjects was reported to be approximately 40 Hz for single electrode stimulation [43]. Available pulse rates in the Argus II are 3–60 Hz [49] and therefore fast enough to sustain stable percepts.*

For the Argus, [because only a small part of the retina ](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B57)is connected with electrodes (wthich rerpesents 20 degree field of view), the patients can only see right in front. But because the electrodes don't stimulate specifically the retinal cells (ON OFF cells, bipolar, retinotopy...)
As for the ability to distinguish details --> 4degrees theory. Because of the spacing btwn electrodes
But the visual accuity is evaluaed at 20/1262, which is actually better than predicted, thanks the computational programs + rehab etc..
20/1262  means you can see the same amount of details, that someone would see 1262 feet away or almost 400 meters...

Now, with this very limited view, what can patients even do? It turns out... kinda lot. 
In stronksFunctionalPerformanceArgus2014, we can see that the measured VA is actually 1.1 degree not 4
- Letter recognitiion: 
- Orientation: Studies on groups show that "the Argus II is capable of increasing the mobility of people unable to navigate or orient themselves without a guide dog or white cane." (just like this woman) (Dad) - But still complementary
- Shape and object recognition: 
- Letter reading


## FUTURE
1. Understand the  neural code
2. Image processing
3. hardware improvement

	So then, how do we stimulate those RCGs? First of all, we have some limitation. The The electrode grid we have are very big, () and therefore, can stimulate them enough. If we try to reduce the electrodes, then it will increase the charge density, making the current higher. 
	
	After a lot of research, scientist find that with a low number of electrodes relatively spaced out, it's positive to have enough accuity to regain vison. 
	For  example the Argus II uses a 6* 10  electrodes grid, and is capable of * generating phosphenes to distinguish vision. The elveetrodes are spaced 525um appart, and the e-size are 200um, which is 10 times greater than the electrode size that will be require. In consequnce, its Visual acuity is 20/1600, wwwwaaaaay bellow the threshold of 20/200

Ok we have the electrodes grids. Now howdo we sstimulate them? #cochlea we find the theshold to wich the patiet starts seeing something. We use a biphasic pulse width of 0.45ms per phase . The pulse frequency is 20Hz and is applied for 250ms
- Intensity
- Frequency

## But how did we figured out, stimulating the RGCs will result into vision (Later)





>Cite the different possible Visual Prosthetics and where they intervene along the  Visual pathway: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full

	The Argus II will stimulate the visual cortex to sense shimmering, light or dark patterns, or spots and the patient must learn how to interpret these signals as shapes and objects.
