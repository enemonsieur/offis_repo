A total of 12 subjects completed four 1-h typing tasks representing two levels of time pressure and task demand. Levels were manipulated by requiring participants to achieve a least number of character strings during each block, and by changing the number of letters in the character strings. Outcomes were measured in subjective assessment of workload, performance-related and physiological measures. Overall, increased time pressure increased perceived workload, productivity rate and heart rate, and decreased initial response time and typing duration. However, increased task demand increased error rate and initial response time with no change in heart rate. Heart rate variability did not indicate increased levels of time pressure or task demand.
