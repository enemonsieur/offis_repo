# Levels of listening
I arrived in Germany a year ago with a B2-level. I could already watch movies without subtiles, read book and even have conversation with native speakers.  Few days after I had my first conflict with a German. My landlorrd refused to check my heather and I was freezing cold. It was like.. 7 degrees. Extremely cold for someone leaving in "sub tropical". 
Even though I could handle my lectures very well, I couldn't even understand what the fuck he was talking about. 

Have you ever listen to a kid show in your target language, understood all of it but when you try to hold on a conversation you coudln't get anything? This is because llistening level are just like language levels A1 A2 etc... and understanding that will make you more capable of listetning to the kind of conversation that will make you

If you're learning a language on your own, you are probably this thing we learn in classroom that isn't helping you: I call it: dispersion learning. 

Think about your Spanish or German classes: You had to learn at the same time the alphabet, study some texts, do tons of grammar, and little to no speaking. All of those skills are already haaard and you also need the constant surveillance of the professor just to follow along. 

But when you're own your own, no one is gonna make you do 5 grammar exercises per day. The more you try to do everything, like having 2 dictionnary, 3 grammar books, 5 apps, the harder it becomes to motivate yourself!

But you have the advantage of focusing on ONE single aspect. nailing it down and movign on. For example, I'm studying japanese rn. I exclusively learn to use new words in multiple context which mean: I hardly care about listening, grammar, and even learning kanjis. 
I simply just add and learn new words in mulitple context over and over again. There's zero decision making involve, and I've been steadily progressing over the month. 
When I'll reach my target number of words,  I'll focus on grammar, nail down the most important parts of it like conjugasion or particle, and then move on to speaking.


But somehow you end up learning the grammar, at the same time trying to read a lot, memorize words. Then you have tons of books, website, apps, and surely you give up! 

Why not focus on... 1
