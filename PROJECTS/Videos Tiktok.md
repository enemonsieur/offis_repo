# Publish more consistenly
Wanna know what separates the top 1% content creator from the crowd?

It's their publishing system.

The only thing that defines if you're gonna publish consistently for months or year is your publishing system. 
The videos they post don't rely on motivation, tons of research or lucking

Instead they have: 
1. Awesome Note taking system: (Review pages of notes in minutes instead of hours)
2. Extremely efficient research phase: (10x faster than us)
3. Viral-meter, imbebbed (Assess how good your content will do before hitting publish.)
---------------------------------------------------

Here's how to create a content-publishing machine
1. Make your notes Future-Proof
(Black White)
Digging out the insights from your past notes (highlights, notes, copied paragraphs, articles...) is often mentally exhausting.

This is because as time passes by, we forget what we find interesting about them.

 As a result, we store tons of notes that are ultimately never used to create content.
---------------------------------------------------

 Solution: every time you find an article interesting, immediately summarize the main points so your future-you can extract in seconds the relevant insights from them. 
---------------------------------------------------
2. Collect what resonates
In any video, book, or article you read, usually 2-3 ideas usually stand out and the rest is just ok. It makes no sense to save every small point of what you read, because you'll look at them a week from now and think: "Meh. Was kinda obvious."

 Solution: you need to develop a spider sense, to guess what insights resonates with you at a deeper level. This will make your system full of high-quality notes, and every content you'll create will be made of high quality material. 
---------------------------------------------------
 But you may be thinking: what if I throw away an idea that was actually relevant?!
 Well first, The best ideas tend to stick in your brain for a couple of days. You'll see yourself randomly thinking about it over and over, even for a couple seconds. If it happens, just jote it down. 
 Second: Let's be honest. How many time did you think: Hey this could be useful, save it, and never even open it again? The goal isn't to save every single idea, but to have a

3. Intermediate Packages
Nothing hurts like spending too many hours on an article that gets too little engagement.

Solution: While writing your 1st drafts, share its key ideas online and gauge how your audience reacts. If they do good. Make them more appealing. If not, rewrite and test them again. 

--------------------------------------------------- 
After doing it for sometimes, two things will happen: 
1. you'll publish more consistently to your audience (with less work)
2. You'll accumulate a lot of ready-to-use packages of content that can be fused into full-length content, repurposed, and easily unders
# Levels of listening
I arrived in Germany a year ago with a B2-level. I could already watch movies without subtiles, read book and even have conversation with native speakers.  Few days after I had my first conflict with a German. My landlorrd refused to check my heather and I was freezing cold. It was like.. 7 degrees. Extremely cold for someone leaving in "sub tropical". 
Even though I could handle my lectures very well, I couldn't even understand what the fuck he was talking about. 

Have you ever listen to a kid show in your target language, understood all of it but when you try to hold on a conversation you coudln't get anything? This is because llistening level are just like language levels A1 A2 etc... and understanding that will make you more capable of listetning to the kind of conversation that will make you

If you're learning a language on your own, you are probably doing this thing we learn in classroom. I call it: dispersion learning. And it isn't helping you. 

Think about your Spanish or German classes: You had to learn at the same time the alphabet, study some texts, do tons of grammar, and little to no speaking. All of those skills are pretty though and you need the blueprint of the classroom just to follow along. 

But when you're own your own, no one's gonna come with a plan for you. You have to organize your sessions between 5 grammar exercises,, then revising words using an app, then learning to speak, and so on and the SECOND, you feel tired... That plan will explode like your belly after a food-orgie. 

That makes... no sense.

Anyway Bad news you can't have a complex plan like in classroom good new... you don't have to.  Just focus ONE single aspect. nail it down (I mean destroy that shit) and move on. For example, I'm studying japanese rn. because I'm masochistic and I wanna do small talk with natives ya know? Like Konichiwa,  ii tenki desune? Yametekudasai. Humhum
So my focus is learning a ton of words an sentences.  ANd I don't care about listening, grammar, and even learning the alphabet. 
Everyday zero decision making involve: Just learn more words/sentences until I reach 300 and I'm getting better.. 
Then  I'll focus on grammar, KILL the most important parts of it like conjugasion or particles... then move to speaking.

So think about the most important aspect of your learning. Do you want to order food in Korean? Or listen to novelas in spanish? Design 80% of your time around that and you'll be able to keep going for months! Guarrentee. (Not even Guarranted)
