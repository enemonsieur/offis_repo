# 7 apps I need to stay focus with ADHD
1. Freedom: I can't resist distractions, I'll automaticaly jump
2. Google Assistant: It seems dumb but with my un focussed brain its easy to forget about meetings If I don't write it. With google assitant the second I plan something I can vocalize it and have it saved instead of writing
3. Mediation App: Idk about you but I always have these moments where I'm too excited, and I try to do everything. Therefore I can't stay calm without my legs shivering, etc... When I need to reassemble myself I'll open a meditation app like: "" and jus
# Publish more consistenly
Wanna know what separates the top 1% content creator from the crowd?

It's their publishing system.

The only thing that defines if you're gonna publish consistently for months or year is your publishing system. 
Until the videos you create stop relying on motivation, tons of research or pure luck, you'll probably give up at some point, just like me. 

Let's break down what makes a good publishing system:
1. Awesome Note taking system: (Review pages of notes in minutes instead of hours)
2. Extremely efficient research phase: (10x faster than us)
3. Viral-meter imbebbed (Assess how good your content will do before hitting publish.)
---------------------------------------------------

Here's how to create a content-publishing machine
1. Make your notes Future-Proof
(Black White)
Digging out the insights from your past notes (highlights, notes, copied paragraphs, articles...) is often mentally exhausting.

This is because as time passes by, we forget what we find interesting about them.

 As a result, we store tons of notes that are ultimately never used to create content.
---------------------------------------------------
 (Color)
 Solution: every time you find an article interesting, immediately summarize the main points so your future-you can extract in seconds the relevant insights from them. 
---------------------------------------------------
2. Collect what resonates
In any video, book, or article you read, usually 2-3 ideas usually stand out and the rest is just ok. It makes no sense to save every small point of what you read, because you'll look at them a week from now and think: "Meh. Was kinda obvious."

 Solution: you need to develop a spider sense, to guess what insights resonates with you at a deeper level. This will make your system full of high-quality notes, and every content you'll create will be made of high quality material. 
---------------------------------------------------
 But you may be thinking: what if I throw away an idea that was actually relevant?!
 Well first, The best ideas tend to stick in your brain for a couple of days. You'll see yourself randomly thinking about it over and over, even for a couple seconds. If it happens, just jote it down. 
 Second: Let's be honest. How many time did you think: Hey this could be useful, save it, and never even open it again? The goal isn't to save every single idea, but to have an efficient system to generate awesome content
---------------------------------------------------
3. Intermediate Packages
Nothing hurts like spending too many hours on a video only to hear the sound of silence (hello darkness my old friend).
Too much of that and you'll be quickly discouraged

Solution: Top content creators often publish multiple snippets of ideas on twitter/tiktok as they work on a piece of content. They use it to assess their virality. These are called intermediate packages. If they get a ton of engagement, that means there's something out there and they should dig in. 

--------------------------------------------------- 
This makes sure that when they're done with a video, they know if their audience will like it. But even better! It give them a lot of small intermediate packages that can be: 
1. fused in to a full length video
2. repurpose into articles, other videos
3. Or ressources for future works.

If you wanna create your own content maschine, I recommend the book by Tiago Forte: BASB Where I got all those ideas!

# Levels of listening
I arrived in Germany a year ago with a B2-level. I could already watch movies without subtiles, read book and even have conversation with native speakers.  Few days after I had my first conflict with a German. My landlorrd refused to check my heather and I was freezing cold. It was like.. 7 degrees. Extremely cold for someone leaving in "sub tropical". 
Even though I could handle my lectures very well, I couldn't even understand what the fuck he was talking about. 

Have you ever listen to a kid show in your target language, understood all of it but when you try to hold on a conversation you coudln't get anything? This is because llistening level are just like language levels A1 A2 etc... and understanding that will make you more capable of listetning to the kind of conversation that will make you

# Does Lo-fi Beats really help you study?
Picture this: You have the day free and you want to write an article. No external pressure, so you prepare the perfect study-plan: Cut your social medias with freedom, make a cup of coffee like the addict you are, and you wanna put some music to enhance focus. 

If its clear that music can help a lot of us focus, it's not clear what kind of music helps the most. 
Can you guess which music will be appropriate for most writing works? (Articles, books, reading complex documents)
... 
I'll go for lofi Beats on this one. Immediately lyric musics is off for me. Studies show that when you're writing or reading, you're actively recreating speech in your mind. The problem is that lyrics of music pass by the same route, and will overload your working memory the "RAM" of your mind. Resulting in decrease concentration. 

Let's try another scenario: Having a very hard boring project like coding or maths. 
I'll go with Lyrical Music there. 
1. Focusing is hard. So most people put on music to help them. But it's easy to get distracted if you pick the wrong music. According to science, here are the 5 appropriate type of music per situation
2. Lo-Fi Beats: Works when you're about to do a creative work like writing/coding, and when you aren't low in energy. Instrumental music, slow beat musics block just enough internal distraction to help youf ocus
3. Brown Noise: IMO superior to white noise, really helps if you wanna do heavy reading/writing/speaking. Because even instrumental music seriously disrupt your phonological loop (the subvocal part of your brain). Brown Noise frees you from the external noise 
4. Lyrical music (Pop, Rock, Afrobeats): Let's face it. Sometimes, you have no energy.  You can't think for 5 minutes straight.. Music you enjoy will raise your arousal level (increasing noradrenaline and dopamine) and making you more engaged, with more energy.

If you're learning a language on your own, you are probably doing this thing we learn in classroom. I call it: dispersion learning. And it isn't helping you. 

Think about your Spanish or German classes: You had to learn at the same time the alphabet, study some texts, do tons of grammar, and little to no speaking. All of those skills are pretty though and you need the blueprint of the classroom just to follow along. 

But when you're own your own, no one's gonna come with a plan for you. You have to organize your sessions between 5 grammar exercises,, then revising words using an app, then learning to speak, and so on and the SECOND, you feel tired... That plan will explode like your belly after a food-orgie. 

That makes... no sense.

Anyway Bad news you can't have a complex plan like in classroom good new... you don't have to.  Just focus ONE single aspect. nail it down (I mean destroy that shit) and move on. For example, I'm studying japanese rn. because I'm masochistic and I wanna do small talk with natives ya know? Like Konichiwa,  ii tenki desune? Yametekudasai. Humhum
So my focus is learning a ton of words an sentences.  ANd I don't care about listening, grammar, and even learning the alphabet. 
Everyday zero decision making involve: Just learn more words/sentences until I reach 300 and I'm getting better.. 
Then  I'll focus on grammar, KILL the most important parts of it like conjugasion or particles... then move to speaking.

So think about the most important aspect of your learning. Do you want to order food in Korean? Or listen to novelas in spanish? Design 80% of your time around that and you'll be able to keep going for months! Guarrentee. (Not even Guarranted)
