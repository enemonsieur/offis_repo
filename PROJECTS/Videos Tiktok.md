# Levels of listening
I arrived in Germany a year ago with a B2-level. I could already watch movies without subtiles, read book and even have conversation with native speakers.  Few days after I had my first conflict with a German. My landlorrd refused to check my heather and I was freezing cold. It was like.. 7 degrees. Extremely cold for someone leaving in "sub tropical". 
Even though I could handle my lectures very well, I couldn't even understand what the fuck he was talking about. 

Have you ever listen to a kid show in your target la
