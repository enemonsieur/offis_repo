# Keep your sport schedule
This is not your normal body transformation. In only 6 
(Make it as you didn't have more space)
years. I managed to change your body. 
The reason why it took me so long to have a decent body is the same why no one is able to stick to a sport routine. 

In this thread I'm gonna explain how you can stick to a sport schedule not for weeks, but forever without hating yourself. 

As Dr Eric Helms said, the most important thing in training is convinience. Most people follow the workouts because they have to and don't enjoy it. **I never liked football nor Basketball even though everybody think I play basket// I tried basketball multiple times because I'm tall and hated it. I discovered muscu 6 years ago and I never stoped accidently and it perfectly meshed with my life and objectives**:
- Pushing you through your limits
- Clear ways of measuring progres
- Very science-based
- Make me feel more focus
Had one of them have not be present, I'd have gave up in a month. If you have a sport you enjoy, just get better at it and your health will take care of itself. FOcus on the sport you like. Your health will take care of itself. 

- The only metric you need is volume: Forget about planning workout, lifting to failure, monitoring your heartbeat. After trying all of this, I found out that only VOLUME predicts your progrees
- If want a sexy healthy body, whether you bench press 3* per week or do push ups don't matter. As long as you're doing a little more: reps, sets, weights, over the course of weeks, you ARE making progress
- If you wanna loose weight, as long as you're running a little more, distance, longer, you are burning more calories
- 
- I've read hundreds of studies on sports. Tried most of the advance techniques, wrote very tight training plan to get better that only advanced sportif

The top 1% bloggers maintain a quality-rich publishing schedule year-round. They do that by constantly turning every content they come across into meaningful material.
Here are 3 powerful ideas by @fortelabs to create a content-creating system, without feeling overwhelmed.

MAKE YOUR NOTES FUTURE PROOF

There are two versions of you: present-you reads, highlights, takes notes...
And future you, who will stumble upon those notes in a couple weeks, and try to figure out what the hell you were saying.
This is a time-consuming activity, and that's why we rarely revise our notes.

But if you summarize the main points of every snippets you add, then you make their context easy
Your job is to  convince him that those snippets of information are actually worth rereading? 
Simple: Summarize the main points of every content. Put them right before your notes. This gives future-

There are 2 versions of you: One that will jot some ideas while reading a book, and your future-self that will have to figure out what the hell you were trying to say. 
Always do a quick summary of every material to convince future-you they are worth rereading

COLLECT IDEAS THAT RESONATE
Usually when reading a book we highlight way to many parts. And even when we reread them, very few stand out. This is because only 2-3 ideas usually resonate on a deeper level with you. 
 If you only collect the heart-pounding insights, you'll have fewer notes to navigate but  more though-provoking for your audience
 
INTERMEDIATE PACKAGES
Instead of spending 10s of hours on an article and get no likes, share small bites on a regular basis. By checking the view, likes, you start to understand which ideas are worth digging though. And after a while you can fuse those approved-intermediate packages into a full article. 

BONUS TIP: 
Next time you want your friends to read some article/video you found, summarize its key points. They'll be more likely to click and see. If they don't, you still have a futureproofed note ready to be turn into content later. 

For years I've been looking for solutions to my 1000s highlights in books, 100s of notes in 5 different apps
If you also struggle to organize your notes to make publishing content easier, here's what worked for me:
1. Make your notes future proof.
	1. As @fortelabs said: Your job is to convince your future self that your old notes are worth rereading. So copy-paste and highlights aren't gonna cut off. Make a quick summary of every important article/book you saved.
	2. There's nothing as discouraging as taking a glance at your past notes and wondering what the fuck you were thinking. This is the fastest way to never look at your notes. That's why you have to make a quick summary of every snippet you take. Convince your future self your notes are worth rereading.
	3. Collect what resonates at a deeper level:
		The more notes, links, highlights you have on a subject, the more your mind works to find the hide gems. So only take the insights that makes your heart pound. How about the others? you can always comeback to them within a few clicks! 
			1. Highlight a lot of parts of a book. Give them a quick glance 1 or 2 days later: Most of those "interesting ideas" suddently don't matter because only the best ideas tend to stick 1 or 2 days in your head. Why not cut the middle man out? If you collect only the most heartpounding insights, you won't be exhausted everytime your looking for an idea into your notes.
1. Intermediate packages: If you consistently publish content everyone ignores,  you'll give up. Instead,  publish small intermediate parts of your projects to test how your ideas resonate with your audience. After a while you get a lot of approved-intermediate packages that you can fuse into a full-legnth article/video.
2. Bonus tip: See when you send a link to an article to friends and they ignore it? Net time try to summarize the main points of it before.
	1. They will be more interested, because they'll know what there is to learn here
	2. You'll make a easy to grasp note your future-self will use. 
Only take what:
*It doesn't matter how motivated you are. If you consistently publish content everyone ignores... eventually you'll give up. No one can sustain content creation without having some true wins.*

Value Hook: I've been running a youtube channel for 3 years now. And everytime I stop because  cant stick to a publishing content: **I spend a long time creating good videos that get no vues so I'm discouraged**, I create small content that I have to do very often but publishing that often demands a lot of focus, and a point life gets in and I can't get back on track. I've been looking for ways to finally **stick to a publishing content (ANY publishing content)** until I read the book Building a second Brain by Tiago Forte. It doesn't only give me a framework to take better notes, but **a solution for all of the thousands of highlights, notes and links that I've been accumulating in 30+ apps (and never rea**d), to move them from raw material all the way to publishable content. All of that while spending the minimal amount of time organizing.
- Le travail d'un créateur de contenu est de digérer toutes ses lectures en informations facile à absorber pour ses lecteurs. On a beau s'organiser, on se retrouve à abandonner beaucoup de notes, livres surlignés, liens de blogs dans nos apps. 
Ces quelques idées vont t'aider à prendre de meilleures notes pour créer du contenu: 
- <>Créé des notes à l'épreuve du futur: Ca m'arrive très souvent de prendre des notes, revenir les lires et de me dire: Qu'est ce que l'ancien moi avait dans le crâne ?
- Parfois je regarde mes anciennes notes sur des sujets comme la neuroscience de l'attention soutenue, et c'est tellement touffu que je n'ai aucune envie de me retaper la lecture. Lorsqu'on résume du contenu, il doit pouvoir convaincre le futur toi qu'il est utile et il faudrait <> 
Les notes qu'on prend doivent être suffisamment 
**As a content creator, my job is to constantly turn articles, youtube videos and books I read into insights for your audience.** Instead, I always research materials only when I'm creating a video and usually can't keep up for more than a few weeks.

Here are 3 insights from  "Building a second brain" by @fortelabs to turn your note-taking into a sustainable content publisher
Here are the 3 insights from his book that will finally make us stick to that goddamn schedule:

3. Intermediate Packages

=> Make your notes future-proof: Is Distilling the most overlooked issue with content creators? Do they only c/p notes and have to reread them and re-understand them? Hence the formula, make your notes future-proof. Your jobs when distilling is to convince your future self that this information is worth digging in : Summarize the most important points, have a Intermediate package.
=> Not all information matter: People highlight and save like crazy, which blur the most important gems and make'em procrastinate. Instead, they should have a framework to decide what matter and what not and it's simple: Inspiring-Procedures-References (RIP)
	=> Progressive Summarization: Because the best stuff always stick in your mind a day or two, so you don't have to write everything back in your Projects. If you completely forget about it, may be it wasn't worth it. 
	=> Here are some ways to only exerpt the highest insights in your reading: The 10% rule: Highlight around 10% of  your reading. Then later, add around 10% of those highlight in your notes. Don't try to add more at a certain moment. Then later, summarize the key points of 10% of those notes. Etc. With this framework, you are forced to take the most relevant points NOW and ditch the other. 
=> Instead of sharing an article to your friends, that they'd never read, apply this framework to give them the 10% best highlights or a summary of the key points of the articles: They'll be lest resistent to spend time reading an article, and actually more intersted. And if they aren't, you'll have an IP ready to be sent to your future self.
=> Intermediate Packages: Now I'm pretty sure you see yourself as a perfectionnist: working on the finitions until you have a product you're proud of
Instead of working hours on an articles before submitting it to people, just to have 5 shares, send small packages as you are learning on the subject. You'll be schocked to see how much of your mindblowing ideas don't interest anyone. Not only will you have feedback about what work, but you'll also be more pumped when an idea with stick, and doing way less work. and by the time you are done with the final product, you'll be almost certain about what works and what doesn't.
# Learn Marketing
5 years ago, I believed Marketing was the most pointless think in the world. 
After dozens of books read, I believe it's the most important. 
1. Elevator Pitch: You know how sometimes your colleagues ask you about what you're working on, and in the middle of explanation you see his brain just turn down? Well what an Elevator Pitch does is it explain you idea by explaining why should people care (problem) giving a brief explanation on how to solve that problem (solution) and providing some proofs of that. For example, I just described the Elevator Pitch using the elevator pitch and it made perfect sense to you. :)
2. Creating personnas

Here are the 5 lessons that made me make marketing my top priority

# Listening to music

^f24b97

Thread on listening to music for focus
Thread sur la lecture et pourquoi lacher les livres - Most of the time if I find it hard to find time/energy to read, its because no book excites me. 
Dump that shit. 
1. Focusing is hard. So most people put on music to help them. But it's easy to get distracted if you pick the wrong music. According to science, here are the 5 appropriate type of music per situation
2. Lo-Fi Beats: Works when you're about to do a creative work like writing/coding, and when you aren't low in energy. Instrumental music, slow beat musics block just enough internal distraction to help youf ocus
3. Brown Noise: IMO superior to white noise, really helps if you wanna do heavy reading/writing/speaking. Because even instrumental music seriously disrupt your phonological loop (the subvocal part of your brain). Brown Noise frees you from the external noise 
4. Lyrical music (Pop, Rock, Afrobeats): Let's face it. Sometimes, you have no energy.  You can't think for 5 minutes straight.. Music you enjoy will raise your arousal level (increasing noradrenaline and dopamine) and making you more engaged, with more energy.

# Books
Reading 3 to 5 books at the same time helped me diving deep on each of them. 
If you think that you'll get confused and less productive by doing that,, here are 5 ways how it helped me read 50 books a year. 

Last year I read 47 books. Reading 3-5 books at the same time helped me  reach that goal. Here's how: 

1- Book boredom: We'll devour the first 50 pages of a book in 2 days, then get to a boring part. Force ourselves to read more and read slower an slower.
By reading multiple books, you can switch to let your mind digest the information, so it's ready to learn more

2-Different books, different moods: Book reading is like eating. You may be full of eating steaks but there's still place for dessert: Having a easier book when your getting back home, tire, or more challenging on a sunday afternoon ensure you're always reading. 



Why you shouldn't take too many notes
	1. It's easy to never enact on the notes,even if you manage to do that
	2. What's the point of writing that much, if you never review 1% of it?
	3. Most of what we remember from great  readings are the key 3-4 points that captured our minds from day one
		1. Threfore, why not just note them, and forget about the rest?
	4. Take your notes, and place them, because you think it'd be usefull for project X
	5. Don't note because it's the notes for entrepreuneurship. Your projects are constantly changign. IT's get lost in the process.

# Speed Reading
Most people think they don't read enough because of their reading speed therefore try to speed reading. Here a 5 reasons why you can't read fast
1. You are reading boring books. Be honest. You don't really enjoy reading 25 pasges of "System1 System2" a day. Think about reading 30 pages of a textbook vs reading Harry Potter. Its not the same engagement. The second you loose your engagement, reading becomes excruciating torture. 
2. You don't read nearly engouh:
	1. Most people think they have to read 2 -3 hours a day like when they were kids to learn stuff. Your average book takes 7 hours to read. Which means, if you read just 30 minutes a day, you can put down 2 books per month down. You don't HAVE to read for long to finish books. You just have to read constantly.
	2. Most people count the number of read hours per day instead of week. I can't find 1h30 a day to read. But if you only read 15 minutes a day, that's 15 books by the end of the years. Reading more is not about speed but consistency
3. You're trying to force yourself to read fast. Reading is the most natural pace. We had 20+ years of experience doing that and we are mostly very good at it. **But trying to force yourself to read even faster will just disrupt your natural pace and make your mind exhausted.** Think about it. What's easier to do: a 10km run in 2 hours or a 5km run in 15 minutes? If you take a slow enough pace, you'll never feel like you're tired. My mentors like Ryan Holiday Michael Simmons that read 1000 of books said it multiple times: The only reason they read a lot of books is because they read... a lot. Period.

The 64/4 Rule 

If you think the 80/20 is exciting, the 64/4 rule will blow your mind. You see we can apply the 80/20 rule to the rule itself. So we take 80% of 80 and 20% of 20 and end up with the 64/4 rule.

So 64% of effects come from 4% of causes
Put another way—the majority of your success comes from the top 4% of your actions. Or put yet another way
96% of the stuff you do is waste of time (comparatively)

There are various areas of your business where you could start looking for leverage points. You may look atgetting 50% better at your negotiation skills. This in turn may help you re-negotiate with key suppliers and get an incremental improvement in your buy price. While this is great, at the end of the day after all that time and effort you’ve still just improved your bottom line incrementally. This is not what I’d call massive leverage. We want exponential improvement, not incremental.
By far the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing
. If you get 10% better at marketing, this can have an exponential or multiplying effect on the bottom line.
Willie Sutton was a prolific American bank robber. During his forty-year criminal career he stole millions of dollars, and eventually spent more than half of his adult life in prison and also managed to escape three times. Sutton was asked by reporter Mitch Ohnstad why he robbed banks. According to Ohnstad, he replied,

“Because that’s where the money is.” When it comes to business the reason we want to focus so heavily on marketing is the same—because that’s where the money is.

## What are the key things that makes direct marketing work?
It’s **trackable**.

That is, when someone responds, you know which ad and which media was responsible for

generating the response. This is in direct contrast to mass media or “brand” marketing—no one will ever

know what ad compelled you to buy that can of Coke, heck you may not even know yourself.
It’s **measurable**.
Since you know which ads are being responded to and how many sales you’ve received from each one, you can measure exactly how effective each ad is. You then drop or change ads that are not giving you a return on investment.
It uses **compelling headlines** and sales copy.
Direct response marketing has a compelling message of strong interest to your chosen prospects. It uses attention-grabbing headlines with strong sales copy that is “salesmanship in print.” Often the ad looks more like an editorial than an ad (hence making it at least three times more likely to get read).

It targets a **specific audience or niche**.
Prospects within specific verticals, geographic zones or niche markets are targeted. The ad aims to appeal to a narrow target market.

It **makes a specific offer**.
Usually the ad makes a specific value-packed offer. Often the aim is not necessarily to sell anything from the ad but to simply get the prospect to take the next action, such as requesting a free report. The offer focuses on the prospect rather than on the advertiser and talks about the prospect’s interests, desires, fears and frustrations. By contrast, mass media or “brand” marketing has a broad, one-size-fits-all marketing message and is focused on the advertiser.

It **demands a response**.

Direct response advertising has a “call to action,” compelling the prospect to do something specific. It also includes a means of response and “capture” of these responses. Interested, high probability prospects have easy ways to respond such as a regular phone number, a free recorded message line, a website, a fax back form, a reply card or coupons. When the prospect responds, as much of the person’s contact information as possible is captured so that they can be contacted beyond the initial response.

**Multi-step, short-term follow-up.**

In exchange for capturing the prospect’s details, valuable education and information on the prospect’s problem is offered. The information should carry with it a second “irresistible offer”—tied to whatever next step you want the prospect to take, such as calling to schedule an appointment or coming into the showroom or store. Then a series of follow-up “touches” via different media such as mail, e-mail, fax, and phone are made. Often there is a time or quantity limit on the offer.

**Maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.**

People who do not respond within the short-term follow-
up period may have many reasons for not “maturing” into buyers immediately. There is value in this bank of slow-to-mature prospects. They should be nurtured and continue hearing from you regularly.
Direct response marketing is a very deep topic with many facets. The 1-Page Marketing Plan is a tool that helps you implement direct response marketing in your business without needing to spend years studying to become an expert.
It’s a guided process that helps you create the key elements of a direct response campaign for your business quickly and easily.

V - Value To The Marketplace:

How much does this market segment value your work? Are they willing to

## One Ads, One purpose
My rule of thumb is one ad, one objective. If something in the ad isn’t helping you achieve that objective then it’s detracting from it and you should get rid of it. That includes sacred cows like your company name and company logo. Advertising space is valuable and these things taking up prime real estate in your ad space often detract from your message rather than enhance it. Rather than trying to sell directly from your ad, simply invite prospects to put their hand up and indicate interest. This lowers resistance and helps you build a marketing database—one of the most valuable assets in your business.
Once your objective is clear, you need to communicate it to your reader. What exactly do you want them to do next? Do they call your toll free number to order? Do they call you or visit your website to request a free
sample? Do they request a free report? You need a very clear call to action—not something wimpy and vague like “don’t hesitate to call us.”
You need to be clear on what they should do next and what they will get in return. Also, give them multiple
ways to take that action. For example if the call to action is to order your product, give them the ability to do it online, over the phone or even via a mail-in coupon. Different people have different preferences when it comes to modality of communication. Give them multiple means of response so they can choose the one they ID with



By contrast, direct response marketing focuses heavily on the needs, thoughts and emotions of the target market. By doing this you enter the conversation already going on in the mind of your ideal prospect. You will resonate at a deeper level with your prospect and your ad will stand out from 99% of other ads that are just shouting and talking about themselves. Don’t be the advertising equivalent of that guy at the party obliviously talking about himself the whole night while his uninterested audience looks for the exit. Also, don’t leave anything to chance. Know exactly what you want your ad to achieve and the exact action you want your prospect to take.

## Develop and Make clear what your USP is
The entire goal of your USP is to answer this question:

**Why should I buy from you rather than from your nearest competitor?**

Another good test is this: **if I removed the company name and logo from your website, would people still know that it’s you or could it be any other company in your industry?**

The common place people go wrong with developing their USP is they say “quality” or “great service” is their USP. There are two things wrong with that:

- Quality and great service are expectations, they are just part of good business practice—not something unique.
- People only find out about your quality and great service after they’ve bought. A good USP is designed to attract prospects before they’ve made a purchasing decision. You know you’re marketing your business as a commodity when prospects start the conversation by asking you about price. Positioning yourself as a commodity and hence being shopped on price alone is a terrible position for a small business to be in. 


There are two questions I ask my clients when helping them develop their USP. Answering these two questions is the path towards marketing and financial success in your business.
So the two questions you must ask and answer are:

- **Why should they buy?

- **Why should they buy from me?**

These are questions that should have clear, concise and quantifiable answers. Not wishy-washy nonsense like “we are the best” or “we have the highest quality.”
What is the unique advantage you are offering? Now the uniqueness doesn’t have to be in the product itself. In fact, it would be fair to say that there are very few truly unique products. The uniqueness may be in the way it is packaged, delivered, supported or even sold.
You need to position what you do in such a way that even if your competitor was operating directly opposite you, customers would cross the road to do business with you instead of your competitor.
Do it really well and they may even stand in line overnight to do business with you instead of your competitor, like they do with Apple products.

## Remember you're fighting against Inaction
Understand that your prospect has essentially three options:

Buy from you

Buy from your competitor

Do nothing

You may think your competitors are your biggest problem, but in reality it’s more likely to be a fight against

inertia. Therefore you need to first answer the question of why they should buy and in addition to why they

should buy from YOU.

We live in a sound bite, MTV generation which has to deal with thousands of messages each day. The

importance of crafting your message in an immediately understandable and impactful way has never been

more important.

Can you explain your product and the unique benefit it offers in a single short sentence?

You must understand a very important concept: confusion leads to lost sales. This is especially so when you

have a complex product. Many business owners erroneously think that a confused customer will seek

clarification or contact you for more information. Nothing could be further from the truth.

When you

confuse them, you lose them

.

People have too many options and too much information coming at them constantly and they’re rarely

motivated enough to wade through a confused message.
