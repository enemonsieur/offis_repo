 In this study, 27 subjects in their 20s who were identified to be vulnerable to stress but had healthy visual conditions and physical activities were included, and their HRVs were measured in color environment
=> Measuring the HRV in different color environment.

Gerard [14] and Ali [15] conducted experiments to verify the effects of color light stimulation on electroencephalogram (EEG) and found that the recovery of alpha waves in EEG was more significant for red and blue colors. Nakshian [16] and Wilson [17] found a greater degree of electrodermal response hand tremors for red than green, indicating that the red color environment stimulates the ANS more significantly.
=> EEG  measurement show red and blue color affect the stress response (longer alpha waves recovery)

These research results regarding the physiological response to environmental color stimulation suggest that warm colors such as red and yellow stimulate the ANS to increase heart rate and skin conductivity response. By contrast, cool colors such as green and blue relax the ANS to reduce them
=> This confirms the red color as stress generator.

=> This study access the effect of verbal provocation (e.g. ‘‘hurry up’’ or ‘‘come on, you can do it faster’’) and time pressure  (40s) on HRV during task (text editing)

The RANOVAs showed significant differences between conditions on HR, SBP and DBP, but not on the LF/HF ratio (Table 1 and Fig. 1). There was also a significant effect of condition on the subjective ratings of stress and RPE proximally, but not on ratings of energy or RPE distally (Table 1).
=> The study saw no changes in the HRV (LF/HF ratio) between conditions with and without time pressure and verbal provocation.

=> This study also show no correlation between time pressure and HRV

In general, participants did perceive higher levels of overall workload (AWWL score, F (3, 44)=5.55, p=0.003) when typing 7-letter character strings under the time pressure condition (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Additionally, Post Hoc (Tukey HSD) tests revealed a higher level of workload induced by time pressure (p=0.005) or task demand (p<0.001) alone, as compared to the baseline level.
=> But the percieved stress of participants increased in the time-pressure task. May be the mental load increased, but not their physiological stress

=>This study look at different combinations of colors on a black/white background to see which one increased the cognitive overload. The task is to identify arrows in a certain direction. Those arrows have different colors from the background

it was noticed that in the presence of combinations with black and other colour pupil diameter increased uniformly compared to white and other colour combinations. However, it is not clear whether the increase in pupil diameter in the presence of black combinations was due to exposure of eye to lower illumination levels or due to the increased cognitive effort.
=> Eye Tracker assessment show that  Black BG + any color result in a bigger pupil diameter compared to white BG + any colour. Pupil diameter could be associated to cognitve effort, which is relatively associated with stress

The subjective responses were also considered by assessing the mental workload by applying NASA-TLX questionnaire [33]; [...]
In the present study the YW and WY combinations received highest mental workload ratings (49.78 and 49.37 respectively) and the changes are significant. All other combinations received a comparatively lower mental workload rating.
=> Mental workload assessment using NASA TLX show that Yellow arrow over White BG and vice versa show the highest mental workload increased (f-value of 49)
