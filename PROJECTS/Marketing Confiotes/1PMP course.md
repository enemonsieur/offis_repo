## What juice and syrup people prioritize
I make my own mix on teas and add this to it. It is cheaper to do this at home than pay Star Bucks an outrageous cost for my special tea. SO glad I bought this. Actually just bought another bottle. Will buy more in the future. Very happy that it comes with the pump. Thumbs up on this product.
I use this to make a very similar mocha mint from Starbucks by adding a mocha k kup and add this peppermint syrup to my coffee.Saves me a-lot of money from going daily to Starbucks.

Amoretti Syrup Lavender High
	I originally purchased because I LOVE lavender mints and I wanted to try the same flavored syrup in my lemonade. I tried all three, because hey, you never know right? Upon opening each one, I smelled them. The lavender, and rose each smelled quite nice and like I thought they should be. The orange blossom smelled quite bitter and acrid. I tasted each one in a fresh glass of lemonade and by far my favorite, surprisingly was the rose. The lavender, was floral and quite like I expected initially. The back end or aftertaste, if you will, was a little bit bitter, but tapered off quickly and left a nice lavender taste in my mouth. I got the impression that I was breathing lavender, which honestly, wasn't the worst thing. The orange flower was the one that I like the least. It was bitter from start to finish and tasted like wilted, rotting flowers. Maybe that is supposed to be how it tastes, I don't really know, but I didn't care for it. The rose however was exceedingly delightful. It took a little more of the syrup than I would have thought to flavor it to my liking, but I could be misjudging because I had the sample size bottle that had no pump, so what I used might be more or less than a full pump of a regular size bottle. That said, it the flavor was strong enough without overpowering and yet light, so you could build to suit your strength/taste preference. It tasted like a rose smells and I swear my breath smelled like perfume. lol The balance in the lemonade made for a refreshing nuanced taste that I thoroughly enjoyed. There was no bitter aftertaste and it went down smoothly. If you don't like the smell of roses, you won't like this. The taste reminded me of the way rose petals smell, right after being crushed or bruised. I liked it so much, I ordered a full size bottle right away. The lavender, was alright, I am thinking about ordering that one too, but I think I am going to go back and retest some more of the sample size, before I jump in and purchase a full size bottle. The orange will go in the trash. Overall, I liked the price because I was able to try 3 flavors without having to commit to a large bottle that I may not have liked and it introduced me to a new flavor that I love, which I would NOT have tried otherwise. If you're interested in new flavors, give it a go, you might find something new that you like. Also, try it in different things, you may find that you like it in one thing, but not the other.
	Another one:
	I really shouldn't order stuff late at night. I didn't realize how small the bottles were. Oh well. I didn't think the product was that great it lost its scent and flavor after putting it in the food or the drinks so I don't think it was that great. It's has a very weak flavor. I'm disappointed because I really expected to get what I paid for.
	SHE MADE LATTE
		This was my first time buying any type of flavored sweetener so it’s new to me. I make lattes almost daily and my fam wanted to try different flavors. I have to say it worked well. Nice packaging, great trial sampler sizes, liquid was perfectly thick and clear. As far as flavor, they were very strong, and we ended up using about half of the recommended amount after the first few tries. However, it was just a little too perfumey for us. Again, I’m not sure if this is normal as I am not used to flavored drinks, but I don’t think I could drink these very often. If you are looking for intensity, this is for you. I thought it would be more subtle like an essence rather than being so bold.
