Local efficiency
	Clustering surrounding a certain nodes
Clustering coefficient?
	prevalence of certain edges compare to possible edges
Between centrality?
	Do we have to cross a certain nodes to connecct 2 nodes by the shortest pathway


How often a certain pattern appear in a network
	Is a triangle pattern appears often? Pyramidal? pentagonal---
	Each of the patterns has a meaning and we have to udnerstand them (p28)

# Benchmark Networks
What the fuck is that?
	A method to generate some networks that have specific properties
	And we compare that to the networks we measured in fMRI 
	and we see if they match. (How much they match)
How many types of Networkds do you know?
	Regular, Small work NW, Modular...
What's the important NW our prof focused on?
	Small world Nw
## Small World Network
	What the hell is a SWNW (small world network)
	What's the diff beween a regular and a randomn network
	What is p?
		The prob that we find cutted edges
	How is this p diff in regular and random?
		The lower the p, the more regular (a lot of edges in the circle)
		the higher the p, the more the p in the inside
	How is SWNw?
		Because of the clustering and the Path lenght are pretty equal??
	High clustering, the neighbouring nodes are correlated, locally quite dense networks
	But we have  ashort path length
	In SWnw, we have low path lenght but still high clustering
	In SW networks there are shortcuts to reach furtehr destinations quite fast. Which means we need few of the shorts Cuts to reach a high path length.
	But still, what is SWNw in term of path lenghts and Clusters? 
The brain is neither a randomnor a regular Nw. Nor a heterogenious distributed network. Which means the degree distribution is quite middle and the majority of brain nodes have only few links. 
Why do evolution favor SWNw?
	To optimise cost effective informationprocessing. 
	If and edge cost axons etcc.. to create, we want less of them, and very clusters. But on the other hand, we wanna be able to go between brain regions without moving a lot so we need a bit of direct paths that connect ways paths

## Scale-free Networks
def
	The dgree distribution follows a power law p.36
	![[Pasted image 20220720144722.png]]
Like one or two nodes arevery connected, but the other one, really aren'T

Exemple: Streets connected to others: Few airports have many many links, and a lot of local airports with small links

How can we grow Scale freenetworks?
	You use prferential attachement
	You start with one node, and add more and more edges to each - The richer get richers
