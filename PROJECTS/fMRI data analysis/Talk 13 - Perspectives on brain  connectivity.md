Brain Connectivity: 
alias:  (ID questions/Blocks) (Summarize/Answer) (Revise 1-2-3) (Mindmap) 
---

Local efficiency
	Clustering surrounding a certain nodes
Clustering coefficient?
	prevalence of certain edges compare to possible edges
Between centrality?
	Do we have to cross a certain nodes to connecct 2 nodes by the shortest pathway


How often a certain pattern appear in a network
	Is a triangle pattern appears often? Pyramidal? pentagonal---
	Each of the patterns has a meaning and we have to udnerstand them (p28)

# Benchmark Networks
What the fuck is that?
	A method to generate some networks that have specific properties
	And we compare that to the networks we measured in fMRI 
	and we see if they match. (How much they match)
How many types of Networkds do you know?
	Regular, Hierachical, Modular...
