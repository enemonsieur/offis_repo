Coregistration 1: registration algorithm moves the images around to test different overlays of the anatomical (T1) and functional(T2*) images ![](https://elearning.uni-oldenburg.de/assets/images/icons/green/accept.svg "correct") , matching the bright voxels on one image with the dark voxels of another image, and the dark with the bright until it finds a match that cannot be improved upon (cost function)

Segmentation goal

I- ~~Do all of the questions once and list the ones that are complex down here. (1h)
10.~~

II- Learn deeply all the confusing questions, + ~~Preprocessing step~~ + Image contrast + Clustering coeff
(2h)

III- Rewrite all the questions + All the preprocessing steps + Describe Image contrast (3h)

IV- (tomorrow): 

---------
12. Measures BOLD changes in the MRI signal following neural activity
17.
18.
20.
21.
preprocessing: 3, 5,6,7,8,
**DESIGN MATRIX - STATISTICS**: 2,6,17,18,19,20,39
4. It's the difference in BOLD signal between two conditions, that infers fuctional specification. Because the brain is always active
6. Test stats hypothesis by contrasting the weights of our conditions
**BRAIN CONNECTIVITY**
