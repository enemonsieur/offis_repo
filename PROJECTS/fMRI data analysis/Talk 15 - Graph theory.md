1. Why do we do slice timing? 
2. Why do we parcelate the brain in different Brain regions
	   - To get mean time seriies of those regions. 
	   - They use a low pass filter and focus on frequencies componetnts below 0.1 Hz. Which is surprising bc we are supposed to recieve a lot of noise in the low-pass filter.
	   - This is bc long range autocorrelation, low freq autocorr. isn't just noise.
