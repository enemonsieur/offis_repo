1. Vascular response to NA
2. **What is the basis of FMRI?**
	1. Detecting the change of N.A. through the change in its BOLD signal. 

3. **Explain the 3 models of hemodynamic activity. Which model is the most likely?**
4. What happens when you decrease the TR?

What makes a neuron use energy?
	Restore energy after ATP consumption
Why is the spatial resolution of fMRI limited?
	Bc upstream blood vessel are also activated even if they don't directly correlate with the BOLDr activation
	Bc vasoactive substances secreted by the activated neurons can leak through neighbouring blood vessels (Adenosie, NO, Ca2+)

What other factors can influence BOLD signal?
	Influence of hormones
	Neurons can influence blood flow in anticipation of upcoming events
