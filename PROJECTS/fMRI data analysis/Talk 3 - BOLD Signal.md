why does the oxy-deoxy ratio increases during brain activity
	bc brain consume oxygen, which first decreases the ratio, but then capillary flow increases, blood rushes trhough the zone and the ratio increases #boldresponse 
how many seconds after the signal does the Hb ratio increases?
	2 to 4 s![[Pasted image 20220626135816.png]

what are the difference btween #magnetic properties of oxy vs deoxy Hb
	the Oxy is diamagnetic the deoxy is paramagnetics Diamagnetics  

what are more differences btwn para and diamagn?
	Oxy will align to the current while deoxy will actually disrupt the magnetism (which magnetism) of the spins of the protons together, this will reduce the Transverse magnetism (bc they won't be align),and reduce the T2 response.
	A reduce T2 response will decrease the activity of the BOLD signal
how do paramagn forces help measure #boldresponse 
	bc the distort the local magnetic field (B), by doing so, they alter the spin of protons. Those protons normally align during fMRI to create a #transversemagnetic field, but because of the perturbation, the TM field will be shorted. This can be picked up by the fMRI,  and create a shorter #t2 response.
	Therefore the oxygenated and dOHb have different t2 response, that is used to construc the BOLD signal
	This BOLD signal results from the increase in #t2 due to the removal of dOHb and increase in OHb

what factors affects BOLD response?
	- stuffs in the fMRI machine
	- stuff about the patient
		- breathing
		- gender
		- hormones
- 6.) How is image contrast produced by BOLD fMRI? #unclear 
	By displacing the dHbO that reduced the t2 response

What are the 3 phases of the typical Hemodynamic Response (HDR)?
	Initial dip
	Initial overshoot
	Post stimulus undershoot
Why is it hard to use very small voxels size? #unclear 
	Because 
	- the BOLD r depends on the amount of HbdO contain in a voxel. If we have an even smaller voxel, we will measure an even smaller BOLDr which risks to be confound simply to noise. Remember that the BOLDr change can be 5% to 1% of its baseline, and that in some places ex: frontal lobe. 
	- Increased image R decreases the acquisition rate by * 2 to 4. This will blur the BOLDr because then temporal signal will be mixed (the BOLD intensity at 2s will mix to the BOLDr at 2.4s)

What is Tr?
	repetition time or the sampling rate. This is what take, per  100ms (for ex), the amount of T2 measured
What's 2 advantages of longer Tr?
	more signal strength
	More brain slices per second #unclear 
How does repetition times influence the temporal resolution? #unclear 
How does TR (repetition time?) influences brain slices and signal strength #unclear 
	For SS: 


### linear system
it means that the bold response will ncrease proportioanlly to the signal. The higher the signal say: The SCHREIII the higher the BOLD response, proportionally.

How do you know the  bold signal is linear?
	Because adding the S of 2 6s signals results in the same activation as the 12 s signal
How close do the stimuli have to be, for the BOLD to be incapable of increasing linearly? (Like double the BOLD for 2 signals) #lineartransformation 
	Below 4s 
What are the disadvantages of high temporal resolution in fMRI? #unclear
