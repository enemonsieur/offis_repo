Functional spezialization: 
- Somekind of localization of mental function -> PFC
Functional integration
- All regions are summed up to realize the function -> WM: ACC + Hc + PFC

What we are analyzing is a bit of both. 

# Functional Connectivity
Do two different regions activated in the same time? Is one Bregion activating another one? Both of them? 
What are the 3 types of influences?
(Question that separate those 3 influences)

How do we measure the connectivity using voxels?
	Find the vCorr within and between subjects?
	1. Seed Voxel Correlation between
	2. SWC within
		1. Find the covariance/correlation of each voxels within all of the activated voxels of the brian
	- Use the eigenvariate?
