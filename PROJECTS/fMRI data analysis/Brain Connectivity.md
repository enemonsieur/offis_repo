Functional spezialization: 
- Somekind of localization of mental function -> PFC
Functional integration
- All regions are summed up to realize the function -> WM: ACC + Hc + PFC

Do two different regions activated in the same time? Is one Bregion activating another one? Both of them? 
What are the 3 types of influences?
(Question that separate those 3 influences)
