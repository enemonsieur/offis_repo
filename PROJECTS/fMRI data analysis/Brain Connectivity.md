Functional spezialization: 
- Somekind of localization of mental function -> PFC
Functional integration
- All regions are summed up to realize the function -> WM: ACC + Hc + PFC

What we are analyzing is a bit of both. 

# Functional Connectivity
Do two different regions activated in the same time? Is one Bregion activating another one? Both of them? 
What are the 3 types of influences?


How do we measure the connectivity using voxels?
	Find the vCorr within and between subjects?
	1. Seed Voxel Correlation between
	2. SWC within #unclear
		1. Find the covariance/correlation of each voxels within all of the activated voxels of the brian
	- Use the eigenvariate?
- Activation induced Correlation#unclear
	- How does it affects finding the connectivity?
	- What's the activation effect?


1. What's PPI?
	1. How do the variable in PPI have to be? 
	2. 
2. What's the #1 function of PPI?
3. What is BSC?
4. What is the single most important thing that differenciate BSC from PPI?
5.
