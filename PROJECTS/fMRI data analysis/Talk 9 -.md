What are the different levels of significance?
	Voxel level
	Cluster ofvoexesl?
	---? 

1. Voxel level of significance
	There's no correlation between voxel,as there's idnependently activated. 
	This doesn't get information (spatial) about the signal. 
	Because we smooth that shit out,the activation of the signal will spread to surrounding signals
2. Cluster level inference
	Ho do we do decide what cluster and what level of activation are relevant?
		You find the t-values of every voxels.  Do a plot by time and define a thresold relevant for the cluster. 
		Set the cluster threshold: Not too low nor too high
		Lack of spatial specificity: You don't know which voxels are significant inside, so not too big.
