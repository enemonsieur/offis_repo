1. ADv disadv Block vsEvent related design
2. What's SOA
	1. 
what are the differents design types?
	Categorical, factorial, parametric designs
	 Blocked vs. event-related designs

**What are the 3 different design types?**
	• Categorical 
	• Factorial designs 
	• Parametric designs


Why is it important to have an element to compare when doing a design?
	• brain has constant supply of blood and oxygen, i.e. is always active
	• In order to infer functional specialization, one needs to compare RELATIVE differences in brain activity between two or more conditions 
	• ->Logic of cognitive subtractio

What are the 2 different ways to present stimulis?
	• Block Design 
	• Event-related Design
Can you give an example of a BAD cognitive comparison to find the neural correlate of maternal love?
	Compare reaction of mother to unknown child and her child
Why is it bad and what's a better example?


Explain in your own what Factorial design is:
	Analysis:
	 1. Factor Stimulus: e.g. where is brain activity bigger when processing faces as compared to houses [uF+fF]-[uH+fH] 
	2. Factor Familiarity: e.g. where is brain activity bigger when procesing familiar as compared to unfamiliar stimuli? [fF+fH]- [uF+uH] 
	3. Interaction: e.g. brain regions with higher activity for familiarity only for faces [fF-uF]-[fH-uH]

What is it that parametric design do that Factorial design doesn't
	 Instead of switching the signal of Tchatse with his House, you gradually change the expression of Andys face



**What are 3 advantages of Block over Even related design?**
