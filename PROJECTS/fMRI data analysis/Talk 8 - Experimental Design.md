what are the differents design types?
	Categorical, factorial, parametric designs
	 Blocked vs. event-related designs

What are the 3 different design types?
	• Categorical 
	• Factorial designs 
	• Parametric designs


Why is it important to have an element to compare when doing a design?
	• brain has constant supply of blood and oxygen, i.e. is always active
	• In order to infer functional specialization, one needs to compare RELATIVE differences in brain activity between two or more conditions 
	• ->Logic of cognitive subtraction
