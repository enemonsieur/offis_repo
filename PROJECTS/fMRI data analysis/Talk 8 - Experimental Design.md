Experimental Design: 
alias: (Summarize/Answer) (Revise 1-2) (Mindmap) 
---
1. what are different design
1. ADv disadv Block vsEvent related design
2. What's SOA
3. Why do we need a comparison?
4. What's cognitive substraction
5. How are the stimuli presented in Block design?
	1. IN fucking blocks of information
6. How's block design different from ERD
	1. ERRD stim are presented much shortly than blocks
7. Why is block better than ERD?**
	1. Why does block has a higher stat power?
	2. Better when different conditions involve performing different tasks
	3. Why is ERD better?
		1. Because the brain doesnt habituate to the signal and decreases its BOLD
8. The HRF acts as whats kind of filter?
	1. LP. Therefore how does it affect the experiment?
		Experimental variance must be present at sufficient low frequencies to pass
9. How long should be the block design?
	1. 14-20s to avoid noise. 
10. How long should exp. Be?
	1. 6 blocks
	2. Why should your blocks be random?
11. In ERD, How close together should events be presented?
	1. until the BOLDr is back to baseline
12. How do we call the timelapse between the S1 and S2
	Stimulus Onset Asynchrony
13. How closed should 2 event be?
	1. Min 2s, around 16-20
2. What happens if the stimulus presented at the same time as the samplig rate? (or a multiple of that time)
	1. 

what are the differents design types?
	Categorical, factorial, parametric designs
	 Blocked vs. event-related designs

**What are the 3 different design types?** #fmriquestion 
	• Categorical : 2 categories of stimulu: Face vs Houses
	• Factorial designs : Contrast different factors: Familiarity vs Stimulus
	• Parametric designs: We gradually change the stim to see if the activity changes


Why is it important to have an element to compare when doing a design?
	• brain has constant supply of blood and oxygen, i.e. is always active
	• In order to infer functional specialization, one needs to compare RELATIVE differences in brain activity between two or more conditions 
	• ->Logic of cognitive subtractio

What are the 2 different ways to present stimulis?
	• Block Design 
	• Event-related Design
Can you give an example of a BAD cognitive comparison to find the neural correlate of maternal love?
	Compare reaction of mother to unknown child and her child
Why is it bad and what's a better example?


Explain in your own what Factorial design is:
	Analysis:
	 1. Factor Stimulus: e.g. where is brain activity bigger when processing faces as compared to houses [uF+fF]-[uH+fH] 
	2. Factor Familiarity: e.g. where is brain activity bigger when procesing familiar as compared to unfamiliar stimuli? [fF+fH]- [uF+uH] 
	3. Interaction: e.g. brain regions with higher activity for familiarity only for faces [fF-uF]-[fH-uH]

What is it that parametric design do that Factorial design doesn't
	 Instead of switching the signal of Tchatse with his House, you gradually change the expression of Andys face



**What are 3 advantages of Block over Even related design?**
