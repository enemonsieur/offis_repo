Functional spezialization: 
- Somekind of localization of mental function -> PFC
Functional integration
- All regions are summed up to realize the function -> WM: ACC + Hc + PFC

What we are analyzing is a bit of both. 

# Functional Connectivity
Do two different regions activated in the same time? Is one Bregion activating another one? Both of them? 
What are the 3 types of influences?


How do we measure the connectivity using voxels?
	Find the vCorr within and between subjects?
	1. Seed Voxel Correlation between
	2. SWC within #unclear
		1. Find the covariance/correlation of each voxels within all of the activated voxels of the brian
	- Use the eigenvariate?
- Activation induced Correlation#unclear
	- How does it affects finding the connectivity?
	- What's the activation effect?


1. What's PPI?
	Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) is **a brain connectivity analysis method for functional brain imaging data, mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)**. It estimates context-dependent changes in effective connectivity (coupling) between brain regions.
	what is effective connectivity?
	effective connectivity **describes the causal influences that neural units exert over another
	**
	1. How do the variable in PPI have to be? 
	2. 
3. What's the #1 function of PPI?
4. What is BSC?
5. What is the single most important thing that differenciate BSC from PPI?
6. What is effective connectivity?
	1. According to the definition of effective connectivity (Karl J. Friston 1994), which refers to the directed effect that one brain region has on another under some model of neuronal coupling, a PPI can be regarded as a condition specific change in effective connectivity, under a simple general linear model (GLM) of interregional coupling.
7. What does PPI measures between conditions?
	1. In order to do so, we need to first clarify why the PPI method always measure connectivity differences between conditions. In addition, we explain the deconvolution process implemented in the calculation of PPI, which can help to understand how PPI can measure the differences between the trial-by-trial dependency in one condition and the moment-to-moment dependency in the remaining time points. Because of this, the PPI differences between conditions and the BSC differences between conditions can, in principle, measure different aspects of taskrelated modulations of connectivity. We use real fMRI data of an event-related designed task to illustrate our points.
8. What is functional connectivity?
	1. The term functional connectivity was first defined by Friston (Karl J. Friston 1994) as temporal correlations between spatially remote brain regions.

	5. Assuming that the functional connectivity is the same during the period of scan, e.g. in restingstate, it is straightforward to calculate correlation coefficients between two brain regions to represent functional connectivity. In a more general regression form, the model can be expressed as: y ¼ β0 þ β1⋅xphysio þ ε

9. What's a seed region?
	1. In most of task fMRI experiments, researchers design different task conditions within a scan run, so that the effect of interest becomes the differences of temporal dependencies between the conditions. 
	2. We can combine eqs. 1and2to include both the time series of a **seed region** (the physiological variable) and the psychological variable into a regression model. Most importantly, the interaction term of the psychological and physiological variables can also be included.
