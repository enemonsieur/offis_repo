swhy does the oxy-deoxy ratio increases during brain activity
	bc brain consume oxygen, which first decreases the ratio, but then capillary flow increases, blood rushes trhough the zone and the ratio increases #boldresponse 
how many seconds after the signal does the Hb ratio increases?
	2 to 4 s![[Pasted image 20220626135816.png]

what are the difference btween #magnetic properties of oxy vs deoxy Hb
> the Oxy is diamagnetic the deoxy is paramagnetics
> Diamagnetics  

what are more differences btwn para and diamagn?
how do paramagn forces help measure #boldresponse 
	bc the distort the local magnetic field (B), by doing so, they alter the spin of protons. Those protons normally align during fMRI to create a #transversemagnetic field, but because of the perturbation, the TM field will be shorted. This can be picked up by the fMRI,  and create a shorter #t2 response.
	Therefore the oxygenated and dOHb have different t2 response, that is used to construc the BOLD signal
	This BOLD signal results from the increase in #t2 due to the removal of dOHb and increase in OHb


what factors affects BOLD response?
	- stuffs in the fMRI machine
	- stuff about the patient
		- breathing
		- gender
		- hormones
- 6.) How is image contrast produced by BOLD fMRI? #unclear 
	- by

What are the 3 phases of the typical Hemodynamic Response (HDR)?
	Initial dip
	Post stimulus undershoot
	Spatial Resolution
Why is it hard to use very small voxels size? #unclear 

How does repetition times influence the temporal resolution?
How does TR (repetition time?) influences brain slices and signal strength #unclear 
	For SS: 


### linear system
it means that the bold response will ncrease proportioanlly to the signal. The higher the signal say: The SCHREIII the higher the BOLD response, proportionally.

How do you know the  bold signal is linear?
	Because adding the S of 2 6s signals results in the same activation as the 12 s signal
How close do the stimuli have to be, for the BOLD to be incapable of increasing linearly? (Like double the BOLD for 2 signals) #lineartransformation 
	Below 4s 
What are the disadvantages of high temporal resolution in fMRI? #unclear
