## Random vs Fixed effects analysis
Its helpful if you have bad models on the first level. ex: The onsets of the lights are wrong (measure time points when there's no light)

Does the error from the 1st level has an effect on the 2nd level? 
	(surely it does) -- the var on the 3nd level is a mixture of withing + between subject var.

Having a bad stuff at level1 affects the level 2 this is called the random effects model.
