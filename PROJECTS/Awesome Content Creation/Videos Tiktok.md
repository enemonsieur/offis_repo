# 7 apps I need to stay focus with ADHD
**This**
1. Freedom: This is honestly my #1 best app. I've been using it for 2 years and it allows me to block social media in the morning so I don't scroll, and in the evening so I call fall asleep easily. Everytime I struggle to focus hard, which is often because I'm easily distracted, I open freedom and enjoy... well, the freedom.
2. Google Assistant: It seems dumb but with my un focussed brain its easy to forget about meetings If I don't write it. With google assitant the second I plan something I can vocalize it and have it saved instead of writing
3. Mediation App: Idk about you but I always have these moments where I'm too excited, and I try to do everything. Therefore I can't stay calm without my legs shivering, etc... When I need to reassemble myself I'll open a meditation app like: "" for just 5 to 10 minutes. If you can't meditate, don't mind. Its not about being calm for long. Your brain will go in every direction as mine does. But if you can handle that for 5-10 min, you'll feel your "arousal level" slowly dropping. You just have to "survive 5 min"
4. Natural Reader: You probably never heard of that. But it's the best reading /listen app period. It's Like Kindle and Audible at the same time. But why would someone with attention disorder need it? Here's the thing. I usually procrastinate doing boring stuff like filling an excel spreadsheet, or running, or doing the dishes. However I try to force myself, low stimulation just bore the fuck out of me. But will this app I can always be listening a book when I run, shower, do the dishes. I kinda combine two boring activity and killing 2 birds. It's such a powerful hack for my brain that I read 40 books this year solely because of this app"
5. A short timer: You know this resistance the first couple minutes when you're trying to do a hard work like coding or writing? Well if I introduce some kind of game into my working session, then it gets much better for example instead of having a 1h timer or 25 min pomodoro, I'll have 5 minutes timer, and convince myself to survive just that. If I make it, then I'll move to a 7min, then 10 then 15. If I fail I'll downgrade to a 3 min. And by the time I reach 15 minutes I'm so focused I don't care any more.
6. Obsidian: But really any notetaking app that's easy to access. Which means not notion. For me I realised if I have to wait more than 3 seconds to write down an idea, my brain will forget about it or actively convince me its dumb. But as a scientist and content creator, I depend on generating a flow of ideas. That's why I looked for the fastest notetaking app I could access on my computer and phone. For me its simply Whatsapp, but for you it could be Roam Research. 
7. This is your turn. Which app did I miss? For example I keep on loosing my stuff: Charger, wallet etc... is there an app for that or anything that could help others? Let me know in the comments!
# Publish more consistenly
**This**
Wanna know what separates the top 1% content creator from the crowd?

It's their publishing system.

Until the videos you create stop relying on motivation, tons of research or pure luck to get done, you'll probably give up at some point, just like me. 

So Let's break down what makes a good publishing system:
1. Awesome Note taking system: (Review pages of notes in minutes instead of hours)
2. A Step by step research process: (10x faster than us)
3. Ability to measure virality (Assess how good your content will do before hitting publish.)
---------------------------------------------------

Here's how to create a content-publishing machine
1. Awesome Note taking system
Make your notes Future-Proof
(Black White)
Digging out the insights from your past notes (highlights, notes, copied paragraphs, articles...) is often mentally exhausting.
This is because as time passes by, we forget what we found interesting about them.
 As a result, we store tons of notes that we have to relearn, reunderstand are ultimately we just procrastinate on those gems.
---------------------------------------------------
 (Color)
 Solution: every time you find an article interesting, immediately summarize the 3 main points so your future-you can glare at it in a split on second and say: "Oh, that's interesting. I should read more":
---------------------------------------------------
3. Step by step research phase

Most of the time, your research phase looks like that: Write an article. Then: "Wow, how can I..." -> Then you have like 300 tabs open, you spend days highlighting dozens of stuff and days rereading them. 
This is extremely inneficient. 

Now  you need to develop a spider sense, to only have the most though-provoking insights in your notes. How? Simply jote down what resonates with you at a deeper level: What contradicts your belief, what is a step-by-step process you could use later but is too deep. A proof of a theory you had. A moving story. Or an obscure explanation you have a strange feeling about.
The second step is to ignore everything else. In this internet age, you don't need more sources, there are million of sources 2 to 3 keywords aways. You need high-quality notes your audience will want to year. 
What about if you missed a very important idea? No problem. Because if an idea is really good,  your brain will kinda comeback to eat 2 3 times in the day. Then again, you'll have a gut feeling it's interesting, and you can simply add it. 

The purpose is to only take what's relevant, everytime you read stuff, sothat when you're on a research phase, you can summon all those gems instead of looking through thousand of notes.

---------------------------------------------------
 But you may be thinking: what if I throw away an idea that was actually relevant?!
 Well first, The best ideas tend to stick in your brain for a couple of days. You'll see yourself randomly thinking about it over and over, even for a couple seconds. If it happens, just jote it down. 
 Second: Let's be honest. How many time did you think: Hey this could be useful, save it, and never even open it again? The goal isn't to save every single idea, but to have an efficient system to generate awesome content
---------------------------------------------------
2. Test your content quality before creating it. 
Nothing hurts like spending too many hours on a video only to hear the sound of silence (hello darkness my old friend/zero likes).
Too much of that and you'll be quickly discouraged. 

Solution: You'll notice that content creators often publish multiple snippets of ideas on twitter/tiktok as they work on a piece of content. They use it to assess their virality. A small 300 words thread, a quick Tiktok video a Question on youtube. If they get a ton of engagement, that means there's something out there and they should dig in. If not then the idea isn't that good or need more work. 

 On their own, those intermediate packages don't take a lot of time, but if you have 3-4-10s that have had likes and comments, then you can fuse them in a full length video, you know will do good. Even better. Because they're not obscure notes on your Notion, you can repurpose them to make other articles, videos or Infographics. 


If you wanna create your own content maschine, I recommend the book by Tiago Forte: BASB Where I got all those ideas!

# Levels of listening
Hello! How are you! I'm fine thank you
Did you manage to understand what I said? Even without actually hearing it? 
I arrived in Germany a year ago with a B2-level. I could already watch movies without subtiles, read book and even have conversation with native speakers.  Few days after I had my first conflict with a German. My landlorrd refused to check my heather and I was freezing cold. It was like.. 7 degrees. Extremely cold for someone leaving in "sub tropical". 
Even though I could handle my lectures very well, I couldn't even understand what the fuck he was talking about. 

Have you ever listen to a kid show in your target language, understood all of it but when you try to hold on a conversation you coudln't get anything? This is because llistening level are just like language levels A1 A2 etc... and understanding that will make you more capable of listetning to the kind of conversation that will make you

## 3 levels of  Listening to music while studying**
1- Beginner: Classical  music
2- Intermediate: Lofi Beats music
3- Advanced: White-Noise/Brown Noise
# Does Lo-fi Beats really help you study?
Picture this: You have the day free and you want to write an article. No external pressure, so you prepare the perfect study-plan: Cut your social medias with freedom, make a cup of coffee like the addict you are, and you wanna put some music to enhance focus. 

If its clear that music can help a lot of us focus, it's not clear what kind of music helps the most. 
Can you guess which music will be appropriate for most writing works? (Articles, books, reading complex documents)
... 
I'll go for lofi Beats on this one. Immediately lyric musics is off for me. Studies show that when you're writing or reading, you're actively recreating speech in your mind. The problem is that lyrics of music pass by the same route, and will overload your working memory the "RAM" of your mind. Resulting in decrease concentration. 

Let's try another scenario: Having a very hard boring project like coding or maths. 
I'll go with Lyrical Music there. 
1. Focusing is hard. So most people put on music to help them. But it's easy to get distracted if you pick the wrong music. According to science, here are the 5 appropriate type of music per situation
2. Lo-Fi Beats: Works when you're about to do a creative work like writing/coding, and when you aren't low in energy. Instrumental music, slow beat musics block just enough internal distraction to help youf ocus
3. Brown Noise: IMO superior to white noise, really helps if you wanna do heavy reading/writing/speaking. Because even instrumental music seriously disrupt your phonological loop (the subvocal part of your brain). Brown Noise frees you from the external noise 
4. Lyrical music (Pop, Rock, Afrobeats): Let's face it. Sometimes, you have no energy.  You can't think for 5 minutes straight.. Music you enjoy will raise your arousal level (increasing noradrenaline and dopamine) and making you more engaged, with more energy.
