 The 24-item SSSQ is a valid measure of stress state which may be useful to researchers interested in conscious appraisals of task-related stress.[ Helton (2015)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1015-5759/a000200)#findarticle

SSSQ is a contracted version of the DSSQ that measure 3 dimensions of stress namly: Task Engagement, Distress, and Worry
- Task engagement: How motivated and focus we are
- Distress: Distress appears to integrate unpleasant mood and tension with lack of confidence and perceived control
- Worry: This measure the cognitive interference, created by our own, self centered thoughts during the task. Is Worry a measure of stress? Can the IBI of the HRV measure that? 


### [[Alsuraykh et al. - 2019 - How Stress and Mental Workload are Connected.pdf]]
“In our research, we have seen both people that enjoy high workload, and people that feel stressed by it, but we do not know whether that experience of stress significantly affects our measurements. Our recent results show that fNIRS measurements are affected by stress (measured by SSSQ).” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1) The SSSQ can segregate stress during high mental workload, but used fNIRS

“Some have pointed out that an increase in Heart Rate is linked with high mental workload [9] [52] while others show that increase in Heart Rate is also triggered by stress [10] [15] [46], and surprise [40], or indeed just physical movement.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1)

“has focused on fNIRS as movement-tolerant brain sensor for use in HCI experiments [27] [33] [37] [44]. For example, it has been used to evaluate the UX of software [34] and used to adapt tasks [1] [56]. While using fNIRS to measure Mental Workload during Air Traffic Control (ATC)” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1)

“affecting the MWL and physiological measurements or not. We used, for example, the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) to manipulate stress (in the form of time pressure and negative feedback) whilst maintaining task demand (mathematical difficulty).” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1) Why was it mathematically demanding?

“The relationship between MWL and stress is much more complicated than: high workload is bad, and indeed that: experienced stress is bad. As there is a lack of clarity in how stress and MWL are related, because they are used to describe often similar phenomena, this paper reviews literature to clarify the relationship between these two concepts, and elaborate on why they are hard to study separately.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1)

“MWL has been described as “the relationship between primary task performance and the resources demanded by the primary task” [52]. In other words, MWL is the relationship between demands placed upon individuals and their capacity to cope with it.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) You're getting a high task like coding. How well do you cope with it. Are you "overwehlmed" or do you feel confident etc... handling that.

“Many measures for assessing mental workload have been developed and they are classified into three types: performance-based assessment, subjective workload assessment, and physiological workload assessment [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) What are the 3 criteria that aremeasured to asses MWL and how do they connect  to overall stress?

“In the case of overload, users may even stop reporting ISA scores, because they lack the spare capacity to complete this secondary task.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“In order to gain better understanding of the measurement process of MWL, the following MWL framework by [52] might be useful. It comprises three main parts: 1) the physical and cognitive task demands, 2) the operator’s workload and 3) the performance (See Figure 1).” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“hysical and cognitive task demands are a reflection of a task’s features that are imposed on a person. It is necessary to determine the work demands that individuals might face in order to measure Mental Workload. In addition, because the demand could be perceived differently by different individuals, it is essential to measure both the imposed demands and perceived demand.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“Operator workload can be defined as “equivalent to measures of operator strain or effort” [40]. Several MWL measurements focus only on measuring the operator experience during and after the task using different subjective questionnaires, however, it has used the measures of effort from behaviour indices and the impact of effort physiology” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) Do operator workload actually correlates with stress?

“According to [28], they indicated that the meaning of the term “stress” has no precise consensus. It has been defined the “Stress” as the lack of balancing between environmental demands and individual capabilities [30]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) defintion of stress again

“n other words, stress could indicate to the coping with the external or internal adverse conditions (stressors), which is the behavioural, psychological and physiological responses [12].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“However, some researchers have defined the term of stress as non-equivalent degree between demands made upon a person and his/her ability of coping with those certain demands.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“Commission Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs (2003) described it as a “state characterized by high levels of arousal and distress and often feelings of not copin” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“From this point of view, it has been revealed that the psychological stress is the consequence of individuals’ appraisals of their environment as exacting or exceeding their resources and/or hazard their safety [30” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) better definition of stress

“0]. The estimates of demanding or threatening surrounding environments are multifaceted, reflecting emotional (affect), motivational (conation), and cognitive processes. However, across nearly all of these dimensions, the notion of ‘too much workload’ recurs” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“In addition, it has been suggested that one definition of stress is that ‘the demands of an event exceed personal resources and is motivated by the emotional response to harm and threat’ and, in short, is ‘the relationship between the person and the environment’ [30]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“In addition, it has been suggested that Psychological stress influences numerous psychological and physical processes in healthy individuals and those with psychiatric disorders, and it is thought to influence mood, memory, and decision-making. Interestingly, such stress can be captured, in a way, by using NASA-TLX (for Mental Workload), which has Frustration as a subscale.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) MEasurement of stress by NASA TLY (Frustration)

“HR [7” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“1) primary appraisal which includes the location of a event, such as stressful, and 2) a secondary appraisal appears after an evaluation of the event, such as threat or challenge.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“There is similarity between the Transactional Theory of Stress by [14] and the Framework for MWL by [51]. In MWL framework, the operator workload is influenced by the way that task is perceived by the operator, while there is association between demand and performance. It has been pointed out that the outcome demand created by a combination of physical and cognitive task demands and external and internal influences [42]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) Looks like stress depends on how the operator defines it. NOt necessarily if its WM is overwehlmed. It's like an embebbed cognitive apraisal related to the incapacity of handling the demands or maintaining performance

“Therefore, if an individual has high capacity to respond to an increased demand, he/she will be less likely to experience a stress response and indeed any stress response could be both” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“psychological and physiological. When we consider these models together then, it appears to be the case that stress and MWL are strongly interconnected.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“3.1 Measuring MWL and Stress There are various subjective methods that are commonly used to assess the impact of psychological stress and mental workload on performance, such as the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX) [21] and the Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ) [22]. It has been indicated that such stressors could increase the mental (cognitive) workload significantly [20]. Firstly, a number of studies that highly connected the aroused stress with reducing the capabilities of decision-making and lower performance [23] which could have a negative effect on person’s ability. It has been argued that task performance could be reduced by stress which influences individual’s concentration and time [39].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“n addition, a great number of studies of the psychophysiological measurements have been conducted to conclude the level of workload and stress from measurements of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. For example, it has been revealed that the levels of task difficulty during a simulated flight scenario affected both the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure [50]. Moreover, several researchers found that the MWL which assessed by the NASA TLX was significantly related to the HR [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4) heart rate and MWL and stress. NASA LTX looks interesting

“Various studies have attempted to measure the stress and MWL, which can be divided into three categories: (1) Self-reporting and subjective ratings using standard questionnaires such as the NASATLX [21] and the SSSQ [22]) ; (2) Behavioral measures, such as primary and secondary-task performance; and (3) physiological measurements, such as including Heart Rate, Skin Temperature to monitor task demand (MW) [8] [20] [50] as well as stress level [9] [14], pupillometry, electromyography, galvanic skin response, and brain activity [51] [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Several experiments have been examined the stress and MWL. For example, it has been found that there are significant correlation stress and mental workload (positive correlation) which means when the subjects have higher mental workload and more negative emotion, they tend to experience more stress [55]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“it has been revealed that there is tight link between mental workload and psychological stress during flight task, where there found a significant positive correlation between HR and mental workload/psychological stress [11” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“ough a large number of experiments have showed that MIST was worked efficiently and effectively in terms of inducing stress level, our studies revealed that MIST increased experienced mental workload as well as stres” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Indeed, its mechanism relies heavily on increasing time pressure in task demand, and this thus manipulating what one would expect to increase mental workload.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Similar to performance, the lack of copying with the perceived demand and perceived capability will impact the cognitive appraisal, which in turn will induce the stress response, that could be psychological and/or physiological [13]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4) How stress measurements influence WML that alsoinfluences stress
