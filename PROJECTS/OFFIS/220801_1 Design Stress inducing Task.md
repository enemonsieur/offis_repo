 In this study, 27 subjects in their 20s who were identified to be vulnerable to stress but had healthy visual conditions and physical activities were included, and their HRVs were measured in color environment
=> Measuring the HRV in different color environment.

Gerard [14] and Ali [15] conducted experiments to verify the effects of color light stimulation on electroencephalogram (EEG) and found that the recovery of alpha waves in EEG was more significant for red and blue colors. Nakshian [16] and Wilson [17] found a greater degree of electrodermal response hand tremors for red than green, indicating that the red color environment stimulates the ANS more significantly.
=> EEG  measurement show red and blue color affect the stress response (longer alpha waves recovery)

These research results regarding the physiological response to environmental color stimulation suggest that warm colors such as red and yellow stimulate the ANS to increase heart rate and skin conductivity response. By contrast, cool colors such as green and blue relax the ANS to reduce them



Here, subjects were asked to work ‘‘as fast as possible’’ and a time constraint of 40 s was imposed to complete each page of text editing. If the subjects could not complete editing the page of text, they were verbally prompted to use the ‘‘page down’’ key on the keyboard and continue with the text-editing task ont he next page. Subjects were also verbally provoked every 15th s (e.g. ‘‘hurry up’’ or ‘‘come on, you can do it faster’’). The verbal provocationwas givenby the same test leader throughout the experiment (JS)
=> This study access the effect of verbal provocation (e.g. ‘‘hurry up’’ or ‘‘come on, you can do it faster’’) and time pressure  (40s) on HRV during task (text editing)

The RANOVAs showed significant differences between conditions on HR, SBP and DBP, but not on the LF/HF ratio (Table 1 and Fig. 1). There was also a significant effect of condition on the subjective ratings of stress and RPE proximally, but not on ratings of energy or RPE distally (Table 1).
=> The study saw no changes in the HRV (LF/HF ratio) between conditions with and without time pressure and verbal provocation. 


mazloumQuantitativeOverloadSource2008
A total of 12 subjects completed four 1-h typing tasks representing two levels of time pressure and task demand. Levels were manipulated by requiring participants to achieve a least number of character strings during each block, and by changing the number of letters in the character strings. Outcomes were measured in subjective assessment of workload, performance-related and physiological measures. Overall, increased time pressure increased perceived workload, productivity rate and heart rate, and decreased initial response time and typing duration. However, increased task demand increased error rate and initial response time with no change in heart rate. Heart rate variability did not indicate increased levels of time pressure or task demand.
=> This study also show no correlation between time pressure and HRV

In general, participants did perceive higher levels of overall workload (AWWL score, F (3, 44)=5.55, p=0.003) when typing 7-letter character strings under the time pressure condition (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Additionally, Post Hoc (Tukey HSD) tests revealed a higher level of workload induced by time pressure (p=0.005) or task demand (p<0.001) alone, as compared to the baseline level.
=> But the percieved stress of participants increased in the time-pressure task. May be the mental load increased, but not their physiological stress

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of various character and background colour combinations on cognitive performance (...)
This study was designed by selecting six colours, i.e., white, black, yellow, red, blue, and green and subsequently combining them to 16 character and background colour combinations for a searching task. Right and left headed arrows were used as the character for the searching maneuver. Forty-four (N = 44) volunteers participated in the experiments.[...]Among the combinations of dark character/light background, blue and red character on white background is highly recommended; and while that for light character/dark background, white is found to be the best character on blue and green backgrounds.


In the present study it was noticed that in the presence of combinations with black and other colour pupil diameter increased uniformly compared to white and other colour combinations. However, it is not clear whether the increase in pupil diameter in the presence of black combinations was due to exposure of eye to lower illumination levels or due to the increased cognitive effort.

In the present study the YW and WY combinations received highest mental workload ratings (49.78 and 49.37 respectively) and the changes are significant. All other combinations received a comparatively lower mental workload rating.



The level of environmental stress in subjects was investigated and analyzed to identify particular environmental color conditions that may negatively impact individuals’ stress levels. In this study, 27 subjects in their 20s who were identified to be vulnerable to stress but had healthy visual conditions and physical activities were included, and their HRVs were measured in color environment

Is the stress inducing factors has to be on a daily basis? Like specific things happening (change in work environment, working with a hard task) Or more global like LT satisfaction, lack of career advancement, or working with difficult collegues?
- Are those factors related to our study? In the sense that we have to manipulate them to increase sense, or is it more of a review


In the IS and the SS, the experimenter was unfriendly towards the colleagues and neutral/strict towards the participant (lack of support), the participant was monitored by a video camera (surveillance of the worker) and a memory test was included (cognitive aspect). In the CS the same keying task was performed but the imposed stressors were, as far as possible, eliminated. The experimenter was friendly and encouraging, there were no memory tests, and the camera was turned off. The computer work was externally paced during all three sessions (low control). The memory test consisted of recognition of words (Nilsson et al. [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-004-1055-z#ref-CR30 "Nilsson LG, Baeckman L, Erngrund K, Nyberg L, Adolfsson R, Bucht G, Karlsson S, Widing M, Winblad B (1997) The Betula Prospective Cohort study: memory, health, and aging. Aging Neuropsychol Cogn 1:1–32")). The participants were presented with a list of 12 common words before the IS and the SS. Each word was in view for 2 s. The participants were instructed to remember as many words as possible, which they had to present to the video camera after the IS and SS.
