 In this study, 27 subjects in their 20s who were identified to be vulnerable to stress but had healthy visual conditions and physical activities were included, and their HRVs were measured in color environment
=> Measuring the HRV in different color environment.







The level of environmental stress in subjects was investigated and analyzed to identify particular environmental color conditions that may negatively impact individuals’ stress levels. In this study, 27 subjects in their 20s who were identified to be vulnerable to stress but had healthy visual conditions and physical activities were included, and their HRVs were measured in color environment

Is the stress inducing factors has to be on a daily basis? Like specific things happening (change in work environment, working with a hard task) Or more global like LT satisfaction, lack of career advancement, or working with difficult collegues?
- Are those factors related to our study? In the sense that we have to manipulate them to increase sense, or is it more of a review


In the IS and the SS, the experimenter was unfriendly towards the colleagues and neutral/strict towards the participant (lack of support), the participant was monitored by a video camera (surveillance of the worker) and a memory test was included (cognitive aspect). In the CS the same keying task was performed but the imposed stressors were, as far as possible, eliminated. The experimenter was friendly and encouraging, there were no memory tests, and the camera was turned off. The computer work was externally paced during all three sessions (low control). The memory test consisted of recognition of words (Nilsson et al. [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-004-1055-z#ref-CR30 "Nilsson LG, Baeckman L, Erngrund K, Nyberg L, Adolfsson R, Bucht G, Karlsson S, Widing M, Winblad B (1997) The Betula Prospective Cohort study: memory, health, and aging. Aging Neuropsychol Cogn 1:1–32")). The participants were presented with a list of 12 common words before the IS and the SS. Each word was in view for 2 s. The participants were instructed to remember as many words as possible, which they had to present to the video camera after the IS and SS.
