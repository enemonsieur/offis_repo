# Definition work overload: 
![[220701_2 Definition Work Overload#^e316ce|Definition Work Overload]]
=> maybe: use of technologies -> increase in workload[^1] -> increase in technostress and (as a consequence or as a comorbidity?) increase in stress?

"High workload is regarded as an important but not a critical factor in the development of stress symptoms"[[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]

"It is quite possible to work hard in difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavourable conditions, without cognitive strain. psychosomatic complaints, or adverse physiological effects".[[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]
=> **Mental workload** and stress relate to each other, but its hard to find a single definition ofmental workload. It can be seen as a percieved tension during the excution of a task.

# Definition of stress

 "In contrast, stress is regarded as a state in which the equilibrium between cognitive and energetical processes is disturbed by ineffective energy. mobilization and negative emotions." [[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]

![[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]
=> Stress can refer to 4 meanings
- input: as putting stress in someone
- output: the reaction to stressor
- state: Of feeling strained
- process: Of accumulating "mental strains" for weeks
# Definition  Mental Load
Intuitively, mental load is related to the extent one is "mentally occupied" and to the effects of this occupation on the human organism. [[@sandersRemarksMentalLoad1979a]]

![[some remarks on Mental Load]]
=> Another relationship between mental load and stress: Mental load = task performance + emotions + tensions.  AND stress = tensions, strains,etc...


"Mental load may refer either to the objective workload imposed by the task (e.g., event rate) or to the subjective ratings of the operator with regard to the demands of the task."

"In mental load theories resources refer to the processing capacity that is available to perform a particular task". [[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]

In most theories mental load refers to the capacity to process information in a task situation. Processing capacity depends on the availability of processing modules, attentional resources and the state of the organism.
[[@gaillardComparingConceptsMental1993]]

## CLT and mental load 
There's a theory that helps seperate causes of mental overlaod: the CLT (Cognitive Load Theory). According to it, mental workload comes from: 
- Intrinsic: The intrisic difficulty of the task
- Extraneous: depends on how the task is presented (See the difference between a pop-science video on a funny maths concept or a hardcore scientific article with 60 lines of equtions )
- Germane: Mental energy and processes needed to encode information in LTMemory *(see more under)*
	“In the context of learning, this theoretical model is aimed at supporting instructors in the development of novel instructional designs aligned with the limitations of the human cognitive architecture [43] and points out to three types of cognitive load: the intrinsic load or the level of difficulty in completing the task, the extraneous load or how the task is presented in the learning environment, and the germane load or the integration of information to long-term memory from the formulation of mental schemes” #workload #workloadfactors 
In this case, a poor design of a technology, say in a power grid, can contribute to an increase in stress of the user. 

As mentioned by Orru and Longo [43], the CLT goal is to reduce the extraneous load that represents an ineffective amount of load in the instructional design. The notion of capacity is related to the mental energy that will remain for the student to create more schemas. In other words, the energy available to invest the information from working memory into long term memory.
>Cognitive Load Theory assume that there's a load created by technology on cognitive ressources, and most of it isn't necessary (Extraneaous and Germane laod), By reengineering the instructional design we can free up ressource, dimish #workload  and even #technostress 
>


Workload can be accurately measure by physiological factors because workload express itself by tension, efforts, both generating change in our: vigilance, that is measure by pupil density, muscle tension, eye movement or even heart reath. 
 Finally, since the mental workload is strongly related to the concepts of tension and effort, physiological measures are based on the premise that both variables generate internal changes, such as the increase in the level of activation or vigilance [22]. 



## DEFINTION TECHNOSTRESS
[...] the inability of the individual to adapt to a type of technology in a healthy manner, and that can manifest itself in the event of the difficulty in accepting computer technologies and in the event of excessive identification with these technologies. 

Here are some of the **causes of technostress**: [[@harrisEngineeringPsychologyCognitive2020]]
- Techo-anxiety: Sometimes people are uncertain on the steps when using a technology and are scared of ruining something (in a power grid for ex.)
- Techno-addiction: Just like  Sandoval (2019) it relates to inability of disconnecting from work and using technology to send messages, check updates, etc...
- Techno-strain^1: Having to learn new technologies every time can cause stress to workers.

Many others factors also play a role in generating technostress: 
	discomfort and fatigue resulting from multitasking, as ICTs allow for completion of more tasks in a lesser amount of time (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008); frequent interruption of assigned tasks due to the ongoing stream of communication (Mark et al., 2008). These stressors, together with a lack of personal coping mechanisms, create technostress in the work environment, placing both physiological and psychological consequences on employees.


It's interesting to notice that the psychological effects of technostress and increase workload confound each other
- fatigue, insomnia
- perceived increased level of mental load and time pressure
- reduction in job satisfaction and commitment

![[220627_1 differences between type of stress#^949d86]]
=>A **definition of technostress** may be the incapacity to addapt to a technology in a healty manner. It can be due to the intrinsic difficulty of the task or the beliefs of the user. Therefore, people feel a certain amount of stress in direct or indirect contact with technologies.

Causes of technostress [[@ragu-nathanConsequencesTechnostressEnd2008]] :
- Techno-overload: workload  increase
- Techno-complexity: Inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies
- Techno-insecurity 
- Technological uncertainty: Not being able to control how a technology constantly changes.
## Correlation Technostress&Mental Load
1. the inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies increases mental load
2. Because use of technology creates a lot of information to process in a short period of time 
3. The information about the new technology may not be suitable for the abilities of the worker: [[@sellbergTechnostressOfficeDistributed2014]]


## Additional notes to ignore
#### Task-technology fit model (TTF)
This model explains the performance of a worker, depending on how the technology used matches its abilities *(more inside*)
	 is a theoretical model that focuses on the prediction of performance, encompassing the analysis of matching aspects of a determined technology with the characteristics of a determined task expected to be performed by this type of technology. More specifically, TTF is the correspondence between task requirements, individual abilities and the functionality and features of technology #measure #stressmodel #stressfactors #technostress 
 Different factors affects the adjustment of the task with the used technology (like using a new coding language etc...)

	 an[ even more detailed model on that is called the technology to performance chain model” (TPC)](Goodhue, D.L., Thompson, R.L.: Task-technology fit and individual performance. MIS Q. **19**(2), 213 (1995). [https://doi.org/10.2307/249689](https://doi.org/10.2307/249689))
 in what manner the mental workload generated by the use of technology can be a mediating or risk effect of technostress.
 Mental workload is clearly distinct from technostress, yet the two concepts are strongly linked in scientific literature. Both can be measured using the same methods (via physiological, subjective and behavioral techniques). Intuitively, technostress causes can affect the mental workload of employees in the use of digital technologies within the workplace. #measurestress #workloadvstechnostress #workload #technostress 
	As previously discussed, the appropriation of technologies is not a cause of the variables of technostress or mental workload. However, as observed in the scientific research, both variables can condition the misappropriation or non-use of technology in the context of work. It is crucial to outline is that the appropriation of technology fosters a holistic view of the use of technology, focusing on how people use the technology, why they use it and which institutional factors (norms, values or requirements) within context will influence this use. The following graph attempts to summarize the ideas mentioned above (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49044-7_2#Fig1)).![[497428_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.webp]
