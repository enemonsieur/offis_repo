# NASA TLX 

"The NASATask Load Index (**NASA-TLX**) is a widely used , subjective, multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload in order to assess a task, system, or team's effectiveness or other aspects of performance."
=>It measures percieved workload, not stress.

 "The 24-item SSSQ is a valid measure of stress state which may be useful to researchers interested in conscious appraisals of task-related stress.[ Helton (2015)]"
=>NASA TLX can measure stress indirectly by assessing mental workload, which correlates with stress

# Short Stress State Questionnaire: Factor structure and state change assessment 
SSSQ is a contracted version of the DSSQ that measure 3 dimensions of stress namly: Task Engagement, Distress, and Worry [[@heltonShortStressState2015]]
- It measures stress state when doing tasks
- It's only 24 item 
- Task engagement: How motivated and focus we are
- Distress: Distress appears to integrate unpleasant mood and tension with lack of confidence and perceived control
- Worry: This measure the cognitive interference, created by our own, self centered thoughts during the task. Is Worry a measure of stress? Can the IBI of the HRV measure that? 

According to [[@heltonCognitiveSlipsFailuresDaily]]   it's a self-report measure of daily stress state
	Recently, Helton et al. (2005) demonstrated that the SSSQ with minor modifications is a reliable measure of daily stress revealing the same factor structure.

## OTHER TYPES OF STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE:
Other types of stress questionnaire are:
	. In this context, several strategies have been used to assess employees' subjective experience of workrelated stress, mainly through questionnaires: the Occupational Stress Indicator (Cooper et al., 1988), the Pressure Management Indicator (Williams and Cooper, 1998), the Job Content Questionnaire (Karasek et al., 1998), the Health and Safety Executive's Management Standards (Edwards et al., 2008), the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) (Siegrist et al., 1997), the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) (Kristensen et al., 2005) and the HSE Indicator Tool (HSE, 2004). However, a considerable limitation of the questionnaires may be the overconfidence of self-reports (Spector, 1994). Nevertheless, several studies have also tested the predictive power and validity of self-assessment methods in work contexts (Podsakoff et al., 2003; Stock et al., 2005), and nowadays, there are many surveys that have overcome weakness pointed out by Spector (1994) as Schwarz (1999) predicted in 1999 and lately was described in a meta-analysis carried out by Berry et al. (2012). (see more under) #quelleumwandeln

- The Stroop task :  Stroop +  EEG + ECG --> Measure indirect Stress. How? **Increase Anxiety** :[[@ahnNovelWearableEEG2019]]. 
	The Stroop color-word interference test combined with video was selected as the stressor because it has been shown to be a reliable and valid method of inducing a moderate level of stateanxiety and transitory physiological modifications (Leite et al., 1999; Silva and Leite, 2000; Teixeira-Silva et al., 2004).

-  Occupational Stress Indicator (Cooper et al., 1988)

-  Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) (Kristensen et al., 2005)
-  HSE Indicator Tool (HSE, 2004).
- The DSSQ:  the longer version of SSSQ
- the MIST: Measure stress by increasing mental workload [[@alsuraykhHowStressMental2019]]

- The Percieve Stress Scale: Overall, the PSS is an easy-to-use questionnaire with established acceptable psychometric properties. However, future studies should evaluate these psychometric properties in greater depth, and validate the scale using diverse populations [[@leeReviewPsychometricEvidence2012]]
- The STAI (State trait Anxiety Inventory)
The state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) [25] questionnaire was utilized to measure the self-reported stress of participants. The state anxiety scale (STAI-Y1) is the moment’s undesirable feelings of stress that are consciously perceived and are associated with the arousal of the ANS. On the other hand, the trait anxiety scale (STAIY2) is a type of enduring personality trait and is related to constant individual differences. Although many questionnaires have been proposed for measuring stress, the STAI is one of the most popular tools for measuring state-trait anxiety that has been used in many stress-related studies


## Additional Notes (Don't have to read)
“In the case of overload, users may even stop reporting ISA scores, because they lack the spare capacity to complete this secondary task.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)

“In addition, it has been suggested that Psychological stress influences numerous psychological and physical processes in healthy individuals and those with psychiatric disorders, and it is thought to influence mood, memory, and decision-making. Interestingly, such stress can be captured, in a way, by using NASA-TLX (for Mental Workload), which has Frustration as a subscale.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) MEasurement of stress by NASA TLY (Frustration) #excalidraw

“3.1 Measuring MWL and Stress There are various subjective methods that are commonly used to assess the impact of psychological stress and mental workload on performance, such as the NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX) [21] and the Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ) [22]. It has been indicated that such stressors could increase the mental (cognitive) workload significantly [20]. Firstly, a number of studies that highly connected the aroused stress with reducing the capabilities of decision-making and lower performance [23] which could have a negative effect on person’s ability. It has been argued that task performance could be reduced by stress which influences individual’s concentration and time [39].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)
>YES


“n addition, a great number of studies of the psychophysiological measurements have been conducted to conclude the level of workload and stress from measurements of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. For example, it has been revealed that the levels of task difficulty during a simulated flight scenario affected both the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure [50]. Moreover, several researchers found that the MWL which assessed by the NASA TLX was significantly related to the HR [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4) heart rate and MWL and stress. NASA LTX looks interesting
