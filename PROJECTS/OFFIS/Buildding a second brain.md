	Organize the bes t way to organize content is only with stuff  you care about now. Jote them all int he current task you're working  like your language cours or grey matters newsletter and tag them approprietly
Distill: as SÃ¶nhe Akrens said the best way to distill is to always resume the notes so that you won't have to walk through them again. You'll really just have to read few comprehensible note and don't go back into rereading. Actually. IT works for school, work, and personnal project. Having to reread stuffs just to understand what they mean is a waste of time. 
Express: As always, knowledge is best remember when we use it. Don't waste time hoarding notes if you're nto gonna create something. Samething with school or whatever. Always learn the way you're going to publish
#notetaking an error I've always make is not organizing the most importnat. For example my matlab. Had I organize  all my matlab file,s I'd be easily able to go trough usefull bit of coedes and snatch them back. Its extremely essential to have them well noted, and tags, and even basically organized so I can come back to them fast and learn them.
	#journaling I dont have to write everytingI want I can also just write how I briefly fell, why  I think I feel like that and what I could do to change it
	#productivity what are the most important problems I have to work on?
		How can I learn better and faster
		How do I keep my focus sharp for longer periods
		How do I connect emotions in the brain
		How do I find communities I enjoy chatting with?
		How do I make passive income
		How do I develop autosustained methods to do businesses
		How do I track my progresses and programs more efficienntly
		How do I redcude the number of setbacks I have every months?


how do I know if I should #notetaking 
	Does it inspire me? Gut feeling
	Is there a step by step process inside that I know I'd like to have so that I wont have to think in the futre? Is there a reference, a diagram that'd make my life easier?
		For example to invest money - guide of brokey, invest in NFTs

#para Use the Para method to store notes:
- Projects
- Areas (what are the things you are doing without ends?)
- Resources
- Archives

- Always try to put your notes in the most actionnable steps. Am besten, all your notes must finish into a project you're currently working on. 

Don't organize notes based on where they come from: Dont put theses current notes in your  "book fucking folder" just because It came from book. Organize them based on how currently usefull they are: Management notes, fMRI notes, neuroscience for content notes, neurosciences in general notes (ressources)

**- Quantum note taking** : Take notes that will survive the quantum jump into the future. If the insights arrive messed up and hard to find, understand, or even remember, youre future self will never give a fuck. 

- Progressive summarization: Instead of agressively try to note every part of a book, try to capture links for article or explanations or audios from professor. Put them in the appropriate folder. 
	- Then later, find your usual links you see. Highlight the most important passages, NEVER more than 10 % of the whole stuff. And add them in a common storage. You may want to include stuff that resonate with you but you can't explain why. 
	- Then comment 20% max of those highlights in a way that'd be easy to contextualize and that your future sefl will immediately grasp
