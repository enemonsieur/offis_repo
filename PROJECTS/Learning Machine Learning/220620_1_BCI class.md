What is important when we do a PCA? #PCA
What does the eigenvalues represent actually?
What does the cov matrix represents? #lineartransformation 
	Its a squared matrix of the variance between the sensors. 
	Taking the squared value substracting the mean for every sensor x sensor
	Bc its squared values the cov matrix is always positive
	PCA decompose the matrix of how much the fetaures correlate to each other, into eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix.

PCA helps reducing the redundancy, by summarizing the data (may that's express in 2D) into just one D only by changing the referntiel to a simpler one
