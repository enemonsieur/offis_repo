Histological examination of postmortem tissue indicated that patients in advanced stages of [retinitis pigmentosa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/retinitis-pigmentosa)  retain only a third to a quarter of their retinal ganglion cells [[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0035) .[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X)
=> This is kind of a serious problem, because there's 1/3 of retinal ganglion, and most of them undergoes reorganization #retinalimitations 

**Retinal reorganization**: Ganglion cell receptive fields in visually deprived animals showed a spatial mismatch of inhibitory and excitatory inputs and inhibitory inputs were highly scattered over the receptive field. These results indicate that visual experience early in life is critical for the refinement of retinal circuits and for appropriate signaling of the spatiotemporal properties of visual stimuli, thus influencing the response properties of neurons in higher visual centers and their processing of visual information.

INTRODUCTION

Cochlear implants have been one of the most succesful neuroprostethics in the world. For the past (sources) thousands* of people have been hearing better and better. More than (sources) percent of people suffer from some kind of auditory imparements:My mom, My sister, and may be you, in a couple of years.

    Af[ter the](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full) development and successful clinical application of cochlear implants ([Rauschecker and Shannon, 2002](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B42) ; [Clark, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B13) ), neural prostheses were exploited in the treatment of diverse acquired or hereditary neural defects including visual impairments. However, restoring vision with bionic devices can be much more complicated. The idea of probing electrical stimulation to restore vision was first reported by [Foerster (1929)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B22)  and subsequently explored by coupling surface electrodes to the visual cortex ([Brindley and Lewin, 1968](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B3) ; [Dobelle and Mladejovsky, 1974](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B17) ; [Dobelle et al., 1974](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B18) ). Some of these approaches were even tested in human volunteers reporting perception of phosphenes. Morevoer, early attempt to retinal stimulation ([Dawson and Radtke, 1977](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B16) ) were also exploited following the demonstration that trans-ocular retinal stimulation can induce the perception of phosphenes in both normal subjects ([Carpenter, 1972](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B7) ) and blind people affected by _Retinitis pigmentosa_  ([Potts and Inoue, 1969](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full#B41) ). Since loss of vision can results from the alteration of any element of the visual pathway from the eye to the visual cortex in the brain, the approaches currently exploited as visual prostheses have been classified in cortical
    
    -   **Proof-of-concept studies: leap from phosphenes to prosthetic vision**
        
        In the late 1990s [Humayun et al. (1999a)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib76)  demonstrated, in acute settings, that electrical current delivered from a multi-electrode array to retina generated phosphenes in blind subjects. The subjects were able to report the location of the perception in their visual field, which was consistent with [retinotopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/retinotopy) , and to track perception as the electrode was moved to different locations in the retina. In another proof-of-concept trial of acute retinal stimulation, RP patients reported the ability to discriminate two separate stimulation points ([Rizzo et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib154) ). These important pilot studies reveal some retinotopic correlation between the stimulation and the phosphenes generated, demonstrating the feasibility of using a multielectrode array to elicit visual percepts that, to some degree, reflect the [stimulation pattern](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pattern-stimulation) . Since then, the field of retinal prosthesis has advanced rapidly, [spawning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/spawning)  the Argus II implant (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc.) and the Alpha IMS implant (Retina Implant AG) that are commercially available, as well as several other prototype systems that are currently in clinical trials.
        

But never before have great helps techniques existed to solve this issues.

Surely one could think, if we managed to reverse the loss in a sense, reversing other senses would be much more easy right?

Wrong.

    #history Cochlear implants first made their entrance in the late 1970s, and it took about 20 years for them to reach maturity: a device that allows a profoundly, even congenitally, deaf person to hear well enough to converse by phone.
    
    Retinal implants have been around for 15 years, but the vision they allow is best described as “moving shadows” and does not allow visual independence to a totally blind person.
    
    #problems the fundamental reorganization of the degenerated retina, the inability to stimulate at the scale of the target cells, and the need to fine-tune stimulation by recording from the implanted electrodes. #retinalfunction 
    
    However, like cochlear implants, which required 20 years of development from the first implant allowing the mere recognition of a word to current implants allowing phone conversations, a similar path of development is expected for blind patients to recover a degree of autonomy in their locomotion, [face recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/facial-recognition)  and common task achievements such as reading. Innovation is a source of hope for many blind patients and the developments in t[he visual system could then pave the way for other neural prostheses in the treatment of various handicaps.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X)
    
    Although cochlear implants use a small number of frequency channels compared to the normal cochlea, this is sufficient for good speech recognition in quiet environments. #retinalcochlea  However, they are limited in the representation of music (McDermott 2004) and voice pitch in tonal languages such as Mandarin, although due to redundancy in the speech signal, cochlear implants have generally still been very successful in countries where a tonal language is spoken (Lee et al. 2002)

        Visual Loss
        
        RP has an incidence of 1 in 4000 with an estimated 1 million patients worldwide (Hartong et al. 2006). 
        
There is currently no other clinical treatment for RP.      AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults; in Western countries it accounts for almost 50% of all severe visual impairment and blindness (Finger et al. 2011). The disease process gradually destroys the high resolution foveal region of the retina via a proliferation of blood vessels while typically leaving peripheral vision intact. At present it is possible to treat some forms of AMD using anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF) (Lai and Landa 2015) to reduce the formation of new blood vessels; however, it is not yet possible to reverse the progression of the pathology.
        
-   **Retinal prostheses: Clinical results and future challenges Les prothèses rétiniennes : résultats cliniques et défis futurs**
    
    When it comes to loss of photoreceptors, retinal prostheses are designed to stimulate the residual retina, while, in diseases with optic nerve atrophy, devices have to activate the [visual cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/visual-cortex) . For such cortical implants, clinical tests conducted in the 70s and 80s showed
    
    #retinaltype
    
    For diseases affecting the photoreceptors (PR in
    
    [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#fig0005)), retinal prostheses have been introduced at different ocular levels. Indeed, the loss of photoreceptors leaves two neuronal layers in the retina:
    
      the inner nuclear layer containing cell bodies of the bipolar cells (BC in [Fig. 1](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#fig0005>)), the neurones postsynaptic to photoreceptors;
   
      
      the ganglion cell layer where all retinal ganglion cells (RGC in [Fig. 1](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#fig0005>)) are generating visual information sent to the brain by their axons via the optic nerve (NO).
      
      ### 
      
      - Epiretinal prostheses #partsofprosthetic
          
          Following this key demonstration, clinical trials have subsequently focused on retinal stimulations with retinal prostheses chronically fixed on the vitreal side of the retina. These epiretinal prostheses illustrated in [Fig. 2](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#fig0010>) are composed of the following elements:
  
    a camera located on eyeglasses for acquiring images of the visual environment;
   a [microprocessor](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/microprocessor>) which converts the image into stimulation codes;
   a transmitter located on the eyeglasses which transmits the information by [radio frequency](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/radiofrequency>) to the implanted device;  
  an implanted device containing the radio frequency receiver (coil-coil interaction), which is connected to an ASIC (chip) converting stimulation codes into electric currents;
    extending from the implanted device, a foil composed with the electrical lines leading to the electrodes at its end, the end being attached to the retina and eye by a tack or nail through the choroid.   
how a prosthetics, the Argus 2 works and why it doesn’t work well
  The Argus II device stimulates retinal cells by currents whose amplitude is a linear function of the pixel light intensity at a frequency of about 20 Hz with a pulse duration of 100 μs to 1 ms applying biphasic stimulations, cathodic first then anodic. This strategy provides exactly the same information to all types of ganglion cells and does not take into account their diversity [[26]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0130>)
          . Cells activated at the light onset, ON cells, thus receive the same stimulation as those normally activated at the extinction of the light phase, OFF cells. In addition to this identical stimulation of all retinal ganglion cell types, the epiretinal approach also activates fibres passing by from the periphery toward the optic disc [[18]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0090>)
          , [[27]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0135>)
          . This fibre stimulation corresponds to the activation of retinal ganglion cells peripheral to the implant and thus to the perception of an unwanted peripheral arc of light. These various difficulties associated with epiretinal stimulation could explain the great variability in patient performances using Argus II, only 7 patients out of the 30 implanted were able to reliably perform complex tasks of visual acuity [[21]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0105>)
          , [[22]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0110>)
          .
          
**Subretinal implants**

  n this case, electrical stimulations aim at activating retinal bipolar cells (or eventually residual non-photosensitive photoreceptors [[28]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0140>)
          , which can then transfer visual information to the retinal ganglion cells as in the normal retina. Prof. Chow and the company Optobionics were the first to evaluate this strategy [[29]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0145>)
          Implant contained solar photodiodes which could directly generate current at the stimulation electrodes. The device was thus very simple because it contained no external component or wire to power or transmit visual information. The circular device (diameter of 2 mm) was simply inserted into the subretinal space of blind patients. Unfortunately, the photodiodes did not allow conversion of enough photons to cause the activation of the degenerated retinal tissue.
          
  To increase the delivered current, Prof. Zrenner and the company Retina Implant AG have introduced an amplifier circuit between the photodiodes and their corresponding electrodes [[30]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0150>)
          . The chip exactly reproduces the operation of a photoreceptor receiving photons and amplifying this signal to finally deliver a current at the electrode. However, the presence of the amplifier circuit requires the addition of a battery, which is linked to the chip by wires and also inserted in the subretinal space but at the periphery. This whole device is therefore much more complex to install in the eye because the chip is introduced into the subretinal space from the periphery and then pushed to a central position.
          
 Why more electrodes don’t results in more pixels (contrast with  auditory cochlear
          
In a second phase, the chip, which contains 1500 diodes/electrodes, was activated by the ambient light as expected. With this device, patients perceived objects, discriminated simple test patterns and could, in some cases, read letters or even words. The restored visual acuity was 20/1000 in these patients
          
          [[33]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0165>)
   . These results were therefore in the same range as those obtained with the epiretinal implant, Argus II, despite a greater number of electrodes. Psychophysical experiments had suggested that implants with 600 independent pixels would provide
[facial recognition](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/facial-recognition>)
          
  , reading complex texts and autonomous locomotion
. Therefore, the clinical results from Retina implant AG suggest that patients equipped with their implants do not perceive 1500 independent pixels despite 1500 electrodes. These different clinical trials have generated very important knowledge for future development of retinal prostheses:

              
  both epiretinal and subretinal stimulations can induce visual perceptions;
  epiretinal stimulations can stimulate by-passing fibres;
the brain can understand this recovered visual information;
   increasing the pixel number does not only rely on increasing the number of electrodes. In the next paragraphs, we will therefore discuss how to increase the number of electrodes and their individual spatial resolution.

          - **Encoding visual information**
              
              Currently, visual information coding remains relatively simple with a conversion of light intensities into amplitude stimulations. This simple coding relies on the assumption that the cortex should be able to learn reading such crude signals and extract the relevant information. The potential for plasticity of the visual system from blind patients is based on reported functional reorganizations after the onset of blindness [[51]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0255>)
              , [[52]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0260>)
              . In blind patients, the [visual cortex](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/visual-cortex>)
               can in fact be recruited by other sensory modalities introducing a multi-modal plasticity; the visual cortex can also contributes to tactile Braille reading [[53]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0265>)
              . However, stimulating with signals as close as possible to the physiological retinal response would facilitate understanding the newly proposed visual language. The current difficulty to properly encode visual information could explain the lack of understanding of signals in some patients.
              
              These algorithms have to model all retinal cell types to prepare specific [cell stimulations](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-stimulation>)
               because it remains unknown if some cell populations are more affected by the secondary tissue degeneration and plasticity. Different models have already tried to reproduce the ganglion cell function [[54]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0270>)
              , [[55]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0275>)
              . If newer models reproduce quite successfully the properties of ganglion cells, they cannot yet satisfactorily predict responses to complex natural stimuli [[56]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0280>)
              . Recently, we have addressed this issue through an innovative approach based on a new asynchronous dynamic visual sensor whose function mimics [photoreceptor](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/photoreceptors>)
               and retinal cell responses [[57]](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S163106911400002X#bib0285>)
    
              

-   Two types of retinal implant ad their differences
    
    R[etinal implan](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00290/full)ts can be classified on the basis of two distinctive criteria, their position with respect to the retina or their functional principle. Two kind of retinal implants have been proposed on the basis of the first criterion: epi-retinal and sub-retinal. In the epi-retinal configuration, the prosthesis interfaces directly the ganglion cell layer, whereas in the sub-retinal configuration the implant is positioned behind the retina in place of photoreceptors. Based on the second criterion, retinal prostheses can be identified as micro-photodiode arrays (MPDAs) or micro-electrode arrays (MEAs). MEA-based devices consist of an implanted electrode array physically connected to a multichannel stimulator. Images are collected by a digital camera and processed by an image-processing unit, which in turn develops and generates a specific stimulation pattern wirelessly transmitted to the implanted chip #retinaltype

Together, they account for millions of cases of blindness and visual impairment worldwide. [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#fig1) B shows representative patterns of vision loss in AMD and RP.

        AMD begins by primarily affecting cone photoreceptors in macula, leading to blurred central vision. As AMD progresses, the blurred area may grow larger and the patient may develop blind spots in the center of the visual field ([Jackson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib81)). AMD affects 30–50 million people globally and more than 2 million in the United States alone ([Bressler, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib15), [Friedman et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib56)). There are two main forms of AMD: the dry form and the wet form. The dry form accounts for 85%–90% percent of the AMD cases and it is characterized by [drusen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/drusen), a yellow deposit in macula that grows over time and leads to retinal atrophy. The wet form, accounting for 10% of the AMD occurrences, involves neovascularization from [choroid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/choroid) underneath the macula. Growth of the blood vessels and leakage of blood into the retina induce blur or distortion in vision and when scar is formed, permanent vision loss occurs.
        
        RP initiates with progressive degeneration of rod photoreceptors in peripheral retina, manifesting early symptoms as loss of [peripheral vision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peripheral-vision) and night vision ([Hartong et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib68), [Wells et al., 1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib203)). Degeneration of rods is followed by damages to RPE cells and deterioration of cones, resulting in the visual decline from “tunnel vision” to blindness. RP is estimated to affect 1.5 million people in the world ([den Hollander et al., 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib43)). It may occur alone, arise syndromically, with other genetic disorders, or be secondary to other [systemic diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systemic-disease) ([Daiger et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib38), [Hartong et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib68)). Multiple [gene mutations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gene-mutation), including mutations in [rhodopsin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rhodopsin), have been associated with RP phenotype ([Daiger et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib38)).

    Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual system. In normally sighted people, photoreceptors are capable of differentiating even slight changes in spatial patterns of the incident light, owing to the small receptive field of a single photoreceptor and the fact that the incident light undergoes very limited lateral diffusion when passing through the ocular optical system. That said, the image presented to the viewer is projected point-to-point by the lens on the retina, given no [refractive errors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/refractive-error). The cross section of the outer segment of rod and cone photoreceptors ranges between 0.5 and 4 μm, comprising the basic light sensing element of the eye. Correspondingly, the 20/20 vision represents the ability to resolve two points separated by 1 arcmin, equivalent to 4.5 μm on retina. In pixelated [visual stimulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/visual-stimulation), it is estimated that at least ∼600 pixels are needed to allow for acceptable performance of visually guided activities such as navigation and reading ([Cha et al., 1992b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib24), [Sommerhalder et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Nqz1-VZCK9IAAAAA:us_Y2mVmggUH6964-S6cJXiuDAwjGVierG5njTubjSwPsnhjG5F5zPnPyz__8PCj5oi7VUUvCtc#bib172)).

2.1 Basic Functions of the Retina Responsible for receiving and processing light, the retina is a thin layer of tissue lining the interior of the back of the eye. One of many layers in the retina, the photoreceptive layer is composed of rods and cones that are responsible for sensing light, and producing black-and-white or color vision. After the light has reached the retina, the light is registered by the photoreceptive cells and triggers a series of chemical reactions. These reactions are passed on to the ganglion cells, commonly referred to as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which is the final output of neurons in the retina. It is the responsibility of the RGCs to convert these chemical signals into neural impulses which are sent to the brain. The brain then registers and decodes these impulses to determine the image and its features. 2.2 System Architecture of Current Models Current RP models typically consist of four system com- Figure 1: Retinal prosthetic system structure [1] ponents, shown in labels 1–4 in Figure 1. First, a camera is used to capture images in the field of view. Once these images are gathered, the data is passed to an external unit for processing. The processing device is responsible for two tasks. The first is deciphering the images received by the camera system. Once processed, the device computes the patterns needed to stimulate the implanted electrode array and cells in the retina. Upon completion, the processing unit will send the pattern through a wire to a receiver used to activate the implant. Inside of the eye is an implant, attached to the retina, which serves as the mechanism for stimulation of the cells. These signals for the implant could be sent through a wire passing through the skin behind the ear. Some are run externally to a pair of glasses used to stimulate the implant; others are run subdermally (beneath the skin) to the implant itself. The stimulated RGCs create neural impulses and follow the biological processes outlined in 2.1 sending the signals to the brain for image processing - see label 5 in Figure 1. When the user would like to deactivate the prosthetic, a switch can be toggled on the external device.

The lost photoreceptor mosaic is replaced with an **artificial array of silicon photosensors located in a pair of glasses or a photodiode chip** ([Figure 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F3/?report=objectonly)). 

Photoreceptor adaptation is replaced by an electronic automatic gain control. To simulate the antagonistic center-surround contrast enhancement of the ganglion cell receptive field by horizontal and amacrine cells, a video processor chip scales and edge enhances the viewed image. Neural encoder circuitry then transforms the down-sampled image into a limited set of discrete stimulation levels suitable for activating the retinal network (i.e., modulating spike frequencies for ganglion cells or graded potentials for inner retinal neurons) within its usable dynamic response range. Finally, the stimulator uses this level information to alter the firing patterns of retinal ganglion cells whose action potentials propagate up the optic nerve to generate phosphene patterns in the visual areas of the brain.
### The Organization of the Retina and Visual System #retinalfunction 
Retina prostheses try to reactivate the residual circuitry in a blind patient’s retina to produce a synthetic form of usable vision ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F1/?report=objectonly)). Using an array of stimulus electrodes or light-sensitive proteins, the neurons in the degenerate retinal network are activated to elicit a series of light percepts termed “phosphenes” ([Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F2/?report=objectonly)). If the patient’s phosphenes act as independent spatial percepts in the patient’s visual field, a crude type of form vision may be achieved.

## Retinal prostheses using electrical stimulation

A large group of retinal prostheses elicit vision in blind patients by using electrical current pulses to depolarize and activate neurons in the retinal network. Retinal implants using electrical stimulation are classified according to the location of their stimulating electrodes in the eye. The prosthesis electrodes can be placed at the inner retinal surface or inner limiting membrane (ILM) (epiretinal), or in the subretinal space (subretinal), or in the sclera behind the choroidal vasculature (termed “suprachoroidal or episcleral”), or on/in the optic nerve (optic nerve) ([Figure 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F3/?report=objectonly)). Each implant electrode location has different advantages and disadvantages for stimulating the retinal circuitry ([Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F4/?report=objectonly)).
