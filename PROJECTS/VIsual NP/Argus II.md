- There's a difference in adaptation /technology between RP to achieve the same results. 
- 
In terms of hardware development, increasing the number of electrodes with or without reducing the size of the electrodes, and increasing the area of retina stimulated and therefore visual field are the most immediate areas of need” (Luo and Cruz, 2016, p. 104)

“. At present this is not possible as the charge density of an electrode, being inversely proportional to the surface area of the electrode (pr2), renders this calibre of electrode unsafe” (Luo and Cruz, 2016, p. 104)
=>We can't reduce the size of electrode too much, because the flow of electrons will increase and destroy cells.


Flicker fusion in Argus 16 subjects was reported to be approximately 40 Hz for single electrode stimulation [43]. Available pulse rates in the Argus II are 3–60 Hz [49] and therefore fast enough to sustain stable percepts.
“The Argus II represents the visual scene by encoding brightness via stimulus amplitude. Intensity coding was chosen, since[...]as many as 10 intensity levels could be successfully identified by one patient [2], a finding supported by the alpha-IMS trial [9]” (Stronks and Dagnelie, 2014, p. 26)
=> To recreate vision, we encode brightness (but not color) in intensity of stimulation. 
=> Patient can differentiate 10 different types of intensities.
Figure 3. A part of the Argus II electrode array to show the theoretical grating visual acuity limit of the Argus II device. The electrodes have a diameter of 200 mm and center to-center electrode spacing is 575 mm. The finest grating that can be represented on an electrode grid with these dimensions has a cycle of 1150 mm on the retina. Assuming that 1 ̊ covers 288 mm retinal surface [63], the maximum visual acuity achievable with the Argus II is 4 ̊. Note that the Argus II array has 6  10 electrodes and the entire electrode grid spans approximately 20 ̊ of the field of view along the diagonal
=> Argus electrode is 200 um big.  Spaced 575um and cover 288mm of the retina. Electrodes array are 6 * 10.
=>Even though it represents 20 degree vision, it only is able to achieve 4 degrees vision.You just have to remember that because of the position of the electrodes, spaming 20 deg of the 360degres of the view field, the fact that the electrode grid cover a total of 1000 um on the retinal and you need 288um to cover one degree, the max accuity it can achieve is just 4 degrees

The 1500-electrode alpha-IMS implant The alpha-IMS device (Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany) has been tested in two clinical trials including a total of 47 patients. The 2nd of these, a multicenter international trial, is still ongoing [9–11]. It features 38  40 (~1500) squareshaped electrodes (50 x 50 um), measures 3 x 3.1 um covers a visual angle of 10 ̊ x10 ̊ (15 ̊ diagonally) [10].
=> The Alpha-IMS is the second most succesful RI.
=> Electrodes grid is made of 1500, 38x40 of 50um each
=> Electrodes cover a 15degrees angle
=> alpha-IMS isn't better than Argus

Light sensing is mediated by intraocular photodiodes, so it operates without an external camera. In contrast to approaches using an external camera such as the Argus II, intraocular light sensing has the advantage that normal eye movements can be used, instead of head scanning. In fact, large eye movements should be actively avoided by Argus II wearers, because of the perceived image displacements due to cortical feedback from the oculomotor system. Rehabilitation procedures, therefore, include training to keep a steady gaze, while scanning the environment by head movements.
=>Contrarily to AMS, Arguss II sense light *before* it enters the eyes, so it doesn't correct for eyes movements. Therefore, patient have to keep a steady gaze. 

 A disadvantage of the alpha-IMS is the limited control over the stimulation parameters. Most importantly, the offset and gain can be adjusted jointly for all electrodes, but not for individual electrodes [10][(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R10)]. In contrast, the Argus II system allows for the adjustment of stimulation variables for each individual electrode.
 => On the contrary, because AIMS is usign photovoltaic within the brain, it can't really modulate the signal (change intensity, frequency etc...). 
 =>Worse, you can't adjust each electrode individually. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619489/
The chip typically records images five to seven times per second (working frequency of 5–7 Hz, adjustable in a wide range) and provides the bipolar cells with a ‘point-by-point electrical image’ of the luminance distribution, typically consisting of 1 ms pulses with amplitudes that are correlated with the luminance at each point. From the bipolar cells onwards, the signal is processed via the remaining visual pathway. The chip size is approximately 3 mm × 3 mm and is approximately 70 µm thin when placed on polyimide foil (thickness approx. 17 µm), which leaves the subretinal space in the upper temporal periphery through the choroid and the sclera.
=> Argus II stim the bipolar cells 5-7/s, with 1ms pulses. It varies the amplitude (?) depending on the external light. 

-------------------------------


The theoretical resolution of the alpha-IMS is 0.5 ̊ [10]; approximately eight-times better than the Argus II. In the first report on alpha-IMS performance, two out of three patients were able to perceive gratings with reported acuities of 2 and 5 ̊ [9], that is, no better than the best acuity reported in the Argus II study (1.1 ̊).
=> No differences between Argus and Alpha IMS

The thresholds ranged from 39 μA to 1.3 mA during the first days of testing, and from 50 to 500 uA at 10 weeks after the surgery. The timing of the pulse was typically a biphasic current pulse, 1 ms/phase with a 1 ms intraphase delay. These numbers were chosen based on prior studies that suggest a stimulus impulse longer than 0.5 ms can target bipolar cells ([Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub#FIG3)). The threshold level of electrical stimulus charge remained below 0.35 mC/cm2 electrodes on 13 electrodes of the 16 (81.25%) electrodes (0.35 mC/cm2 is an established long-term safety limit for platinum when pulses of at least 0.6 ms are used) ([Greenberg, 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub#BIB3)). The threshold stimulus for each electrode position is shown on first day of stimulation and then 2.5 months later in [Fig. 4A, B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub#FIG4). The most dramatic decrease in threshold was seen at the electrodes furthest away from the fovea (i.e. at the perimeter of the electrode array). Electrode impedances ranged from 4 to 55 kOhms (at 1 KHz, average, 23 kOhms) over 2.5 months of testing ([Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub#FIG5)).
=> Studies on Retinal stimuli, show that:
=> Threshold to perceive phosphenes after stimulation ranged around 50-500  uA - Best was 1ms/phase biphasic pulse, bc they reach bipolar cells.
=> Doing so keeps the current below 0.35 mC/cm2 which is considered LT safety in those conditions. 
=>

Brightness tests revealed that with increasing or decreasing current the visual perception got brighter or dimmer, respectively. For each of the 12 electrodes tested the current was decreased 12 times and increased eight times by 6–12% each transition (20 transitions per electrode). On average, the subject identified the transition correctly more than 74% of the time (chance=50% correct). The subject was given an arbitrary scale of 0–10 with 10 being the brightest and 0 representing no perception. During the course of the 2.5 months, the subject identified all 10 levels of brightness on all tested electrodes. However, in general the percepts produced by the electrodes nearer the fovea demonstrated a more consistent correlation between brightness and stimulus current. In contrast, the percepts generated by peripheral electrodes in general were less responsive to increases in stimulus current and tended to remain dim.
=> RP can modulate change in brightness pretty well, as patient are able to discriminate 10 levels of brightness for each electrodes. Especially around the middle (fovea) Since there are more cells and direct c-c interactions. (questions)

The electrode size for this prototype was based on safely supplying a stimulus current of 700 μA for 1 ms. This corresponds to charge density less than 0.35 mC/cm2. Since the actual current needed is in many cases lower, electrodes can be made smaller yet still support the same current. Thus, lower current requirements may lead to the use of a smaller, more densely packed electrode array that would put hundreds of individual percepts in the macula, possibly increasing the resolution afforded by the implant ([Robblee & Rose, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698903004577?via%3Dihub#BIB16)).
=> Stim of around 700uA - 1ms pulse works best.

	![[Pasted image 20220717130228.png]]
Brightness increased as a function of both amplitude and frequency. [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F4/)A shows brightness ratings as a function of increasing amplitude in the modulated-amplitude condition: brightness increased with amplitude, as indicated by slope of the best-fit line being significantly larger than 0 in seven of nine electrodes (_P_ < 0.01, one-tailed Student's _t_-test for seven electrodes, _P_ > 0.05 in the remaining 2). [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F4/)B shows brightness ratings as a function of increasing frequency in the modulated-frequency condition: apparent brightness increased as a function of frequency for all nine electrodes (_P_ < 0.01, one-tailed Student's _t_-test).
=> How is brightness of phosphenes modulate by the stim? If we increase the pulse frequency and the amplitude from 1 to 7 uA, we see a gradual increase in brightness rating. Same by frequencies: from 20 to 120 Hz

Apparent size always increased with increasing amplitude, but generally did not increase with frequency. [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F4/)C shows drawing size (mean area) as a function of amplitude in the modulated-amplitude condition: For all nine electrodes, the size of the phosphenes increased as a function of amplitude (_P_ < 0.01, one-tailed Student's _t_-test). [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F4/)D shows size as a function of frequency in the modulated-frequency condition; in six of nine electrodes, size did not vary with frequency (_P_ > 0.05); and in the remaining three electrodes slopes were significantly larger than 0 (_P_ < 0.01, one-tailed Student's _t_-test). Although phosphene size significantly increased in three electrodes, in all cases the slopes (_s_) were relatively shallow (_s_ = 0.3%–4.2% increase/ Hz). In other words, a doubling of the amplitude resulted in a 1.7 to 2.9× (mean, 2.2×) increase in size, whereas a doubling of the frequency resulted in only a 1 to 1.8× (mean, 1.2×) increase in size (normalized by frequency). Slope values and corresponding statistics for [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F4/) plots are also shown in [Table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/table/T2/).
=>The size of the perceived Phosphenes don't  really increase with  frequencies, only with the amplitudes.

### Computational Modeling

These results can be qualitatively described using a simple model based on estimates of the spread of current from a metal disc in a semi-infinite medium (based on electrophysiological spatial threshold data)[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B36) and the perceptual sensitivity model by Horsager et al.,[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B25) previously used by our group to predict the perceptual sensitivity of the retina to electrical stimulation in human subjects. As described previously, this model bears a strong resemblance to models used to describe both temporal sensitivity for normal vision and retinal sensitivity to electrical stimulation, as measured neurophysiologically,[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B37)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B38)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B39)–[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B40) and can predict both absolute thresholds and suprathreshold brightness matching across a wide variety of pulse trains. A schematic of the model is shown in [Figure 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/).
=>This model predicts the spread of the current in the retina + how the phosphenes are gonna be percieved. It predicts how differents pulse trains will result in different brightnesses.

[Figure 6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/)

The study model. BOX 1: the time stimulus, _f_(_t_), was transformed into a spatiotemporal representation, on the basis of the measured electrophysiological thresholds from a disc electrode. BOXES 2–5: the output was then passed through a modified version of the perceptual sensitivity model incorporating threshold and suprathreshold parameters. The resulting output corresponds to a spatial brightness response, _B_(_r_).
=> Transform the pulse at the electrode in the spreading of the current aroudnthe electrode. Using a spatial attenuation function. 
=>The attenuatio varries with the distance from the center, and the radius of the electrode. Which makes sense right? 
We began by applying a spatial attenuation function to the temporal input stimulus pulse train to produce _b_1_(r,t_), a spatiotemporal stimulus profile:

![equation image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/bin/z7g00112-2296-m01.jpg "equation image")

where _f_(_t_) is the electrical stimulation input pattern, _t_ is the time (in milliseconds), _r_ is the distance from the center of the stimulating electrode (in micrometers), and _I_(_r_) is the current attenuation from a disc electrode. The function used to model the spatial attenuation of current is given by

![equation image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/bin/z7g00112-2296-m02.jpg "equation image")

where _r_ is the distance from the center of the stimulating disc electrode, and _a_ is the radius of the electrode ([Fig. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/), BOX 1). The _I_(_r_) function was obtained by inverting the relationship between threshold and distance from the edge of a 200-μm diameter platinum disc electrode (previously reported in Ahuja et al.[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B36)). In that paper, thresholds from salamander retina were shown to increase with distance _r_ from the stimulating electrode. We assumed that current attenuation at distance _r_ was inversely proportional to the increase in threshold at _r_.

We then passed this spatiotemporal stimulus through the perceptual sensitivity model. In brief, the stimulus was convolved with a temporal low-pass filter that had a one-stage gamma function with a time constant τ1 = 0.42 ms as its impulse response ([Fig. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/), BOX 2). 
=> Then we apply the perceptual sensitivity model, using a low-pass filter with a particulat Time Constant. 
We then assumed that the system became less sensitive as a function of accumulated charge and calculated the amount of accumulated cathodic charge over time, and convolving this accumulation with a second one-stage gamma function with time constant τ2 = 45.25 ms ([Fig. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/), BOX 3). The output of this convolution was scaled (by a factor ε = 8.73) and subtracted from the output of the first convolution. The resulting time course was half rectified.
=> Then we convolve the amount of charges accumulated over time, with another gamma fuction, we half rectify it then. This gives us the amplitude/frequency required to reach a certain brightness level. 

The previous instantiation of this model determined the amplitude or frequency required to reach threshold or a fixed brightness level. To do this, the half-rectified output, _b_3(_r_,_t_), was passed through a power nonlinearity of β = 3.4 at threshold and β = 0.8 at suprathreshold. For our purposes a continuous mapping of amplitude/frequency to brightness was required. We therefore replaced β with a continuous function that nonlinearly rescaled _b_3(_r_,_t_), across space and time, based on a sigmoidal function dependent on the maximum value of _b_3(_r_,_t_; [Fig. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/), BOX 4):
=> We then pass the results through a through a power nonlinearity and a sigmoidal fxn. 

![equation image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/bin/z7g00112-2296-m03.jpg "equation image")

The parameter values of _a_ (asymptote) = 14, _s_ (slope) = 3, and _i_ (shift) = 16 were chosen to match the observed psychophysical data. Interestingly, for parameter values that reproduced the observed behavior, we found that the sigmoidal function had an accelerating slope near threshold and a compressive slope when amplitude values were at suprathreshold levels: properties very similar to those demonstrated by parameter β in the original Horsager model. These were the only free parameters used to develop this model. All other parameters were based on those of the original Horsager data and model.

Finally, as in the Horsager model, the output, _b_4(_r_,_t_) was convolved with a low-pass filter described using a three-stage gamma function with time constant τ3 = 26.25 ms ([Fig. 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F6/), BOX 5). The maximum value of the output from this slow integration over time was used to represent the brightness response for each location in space, _B_(_r_). For a given stimulus, the brightness of a phosphene was assumed to be linearly related to the maximum brightness of the _B_(_r_) plot. We estimated the size of the phosphene by calculating the area where _B_(_r_) > ϴ, where ϴ was fixed as the maximum brightness elicited by a threshold stimulus.
=> Finally we convolve with a LP filter using a 3-stage gamma fxn. We find a max value of the output and this is our brightness response for each location in space.
=> With than we can estimatethe size and brightness of a phosphene

Thus, most of the parameters in this model (τ1, τ2, τ3, and ε) were fixed on the basis of previous work or separate measurements of threshold. Only the parameters of the sigmoid function (_a_, _s_, and _i_) were varied to match our psychophysical results.

Phosphene predictions generated with this model are shown in [Figure 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F7/). The top row shows the effect of increasing amplitude and the bottom row shows the effect of increasing frequency. Note that the 1.25× threshold with a 20-Hz stimulus (outlined images) is common to both the amplitude modulation and the frequency modulation conditions. The maximum value of _B_(_r_), representing the brightness of the phosphene, is reported below each simulated phosphene. Analogous to our psychophysical data, the model replicates the finding that increasing current amplitude results in increases in both brightness and size, whereas increasing frequency results in an increase in apparent brightness, but little increase in size. The model also replicates the finding that larger increases in apparent brightness can be elicited by changes in frequency than by changes in current amplitude.
	![[Pasted image 20220717153215.png]]
=> The results of the computational model, is correspondant with empirical data, that increase amp-> size&brightness (but not much) and incr. freq -> brightness
A possible explanation for this observation is that increasing amplitude increases brightness by producing multiple spikes per pulse,[54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B54) which is interpreted by the visual system as increased brightness. However, cell refractory properties will eventually impose an upper limit on the number of spikes elicited by a single pulse, and at that point, further increases in amplitude beyond that amplitude will not increase the rate of neural response.

### Stimulation Thresholds

Mean thresholds over the entire period during which we collected data are shown for each electrode and subject in [Figure 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/figure/F3/). Mean thresholds decreased dramatically across subject implantations. Thresholds in S1 varied between 173 (most sensitive electrode) and 902 (least sensitive electrode) μA. Note that subject S1 was much older than the other subjects, had no light perception (NLP) vision for much longer than any of the other subjects, and may have had confounding retinal or optic nerve damage. Platinum has a conservative, safe, long-term (i.e., long-term stimulation using pulse trains) stimulation limit of 0.35 mC/cm2 per pulse.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R34),[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R35) For some electrodes in S1, charge density levels above 0.35 mC/cm2 were necessary to obtain threshold (stimulation was always kept below 1 mC/cm2). Thresholds in S2 were also relatively high, ranging between 121 and 404 μA. By comparison, the thresholds in S6 varied between 17 and 73 μA. These differences in threshold did not change systematically with the patient's age; level of preoperative vision, as recorded clinically or measured using the dark-adapted light flash[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R29); preoperative electrically evoked responses measured with a Burian-Allen corneal electrode[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R29); or implant technology. However, thresholds appeared to decrease systematically across successive surgeries, perhaps because the positioning of the electrode array was successively closer to the retinal surface on each surgery. Note that there was no noticeable difference in thresholds between 260- and 520-μm electrodes, either within or across subjects.
=> Studies done on patients, show that the mean Threshold varies from 173 to 902 uA. Which is pretty high because they had to increase the charde density above the safe limits. 
=> Threshold levels vary with the age, the distance array-retina, but not with electrode size. 

-----------------
#### Retinal Stimulation. 

In the retinal stimulation experiments, stimuli were charge-balanced, 0.45 ms/phase cathodic-first biphasic pulse trains that were always 500 ms in duration. Pulses were charge balanced across cathodic and anodic pulses for safety reasons. Each pulse train was presented on a single electrode, and nine electrodes were tested in total. Chosen electrodes had the greatest dynamic range. All data were recorded under photopic conditions.
Phosphene shape and brightness were manipulated in two ways. In the _modulated-amplitude_ condition, we modulated current amplitude between 1.2× and 6× threshold (threshold was defined in a separate experimental run with a 20-Hz pulse train and using a method of adjustment procedure described previously[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/#B24)), while holding the frequency constant at 20 Hz. In the _modulated-frequency_ condition, the frequency of the pulse train was varied between 13 and 120 Hz, while current amplitude was held constant at 1.25× threshold ([Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292357/figure/F1/)C).
=> With our threshold defined in other studies, we could apply 1-2 to 6 times the amplitude
=> Alternatively, they changed the frequency (10 fold, 13-120 Hz) and kept the amp. 

In S5 and S6, the maximum (across all 16 electrodes) threshold was less than 100 μA for a single biphasic 0.975-ms pulse. These thresholds are well below charge density limits of 0.35 mC/cm2, which would permit current amplitude limits of 190.6 μA for 260-μm-diameter electrodes and current amplitude limits of 762.4 μA for 520-μm electrodes. It should also be noted that these thresholds are for a single pulse, whereas functional electrical stimulation is likely to be mediated by pulse trains, which generally require lower stimulation thresholds.

As described in the introduction, electric fields diminish with the distance from the electrode.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R18),[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R19),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R36) The dependence of threshold on distance can be described by a power function for electrode–retina distances much larger than the cell body. This relationship is affected by electrode size, with larger electrodes showing a shallower increase in the amount of necessary current as a function of distance. The solid lines in [Figure 7b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/figure/F7/) show predicted thresholds based on a model of Palanker et al.,[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/#R19) in which the necessary voltage decrease was allowed to vary as a free parameter. The good fit of this model suggests that, for our array configuration, modeling the electric field current in an isotropic medium with distant boundaries may provide a reasonable model for electrical stimulation thresholds.
=> Bigger electrode size increase the E-field which increase our threshold. (Remind what TH is )

As shown in [Figure 7c](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/figure/F7/), across subjects there was a negative correlation between log impedance and log distance of the electrode from the retinal surface (_e_ = −0.08, _f_ = 3.08, _P_ < 0.01). However, the exponent was significantly less than 0 in only two of the five subjects for which OCT data were available ([Table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517253/table/T2/)). When this analysis was performed separately for 260- and 520-μm electrodes, a similar negative correlation was found between impedance and distance of the electrode from the retinal surface for both sizes of electrodes. For 260-μm electrodes, there was a significant negative correlation in two of the four subjects. One subject (S4) showed a positive correlation between electrode–retina distance and impedance. For 520-μm electrodes there was a significant negative correlation in two of the four subjects.

The Argus® II Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products) is the first prosthetic vision device to obtain regulatory approval in both Europe and the USA.
To date, over 100 devices have been implanted worldwide, representing the largest group of patients currently treated with visual prostheses. (now 800)
-> How succesful is the ARgus
How does the Argus works?
	Visual information from a glasses-mounted video camera is converted to a pixelated image by an external processor, before being transmitted to the microelectrode array at the macula. Elicited retinal responses are then relayed via the normal optic nerve to the cortex for interpretation. #retinalfunction 


How succesful is the Argus
	The Argus® II has become the most widely used and most successful retinal prosthesis currently available in terms of regulatory approval. Since obtaining the CE mark in 2011 and FDA approval as a humanitarian device in 2013,
BUt why is it so much better than the other RP?
	a) greater accessibility at **lower surgical risk** than the intracranial visual pathways
	b) straightforward monitoring of the device by direct visualisation; ???
	c) **potentially predictable and reproducible retinotopy by applying stimulation at a pre-processing site.**  
=> it stimulates the RGCs that stimulates what?
Not all the information capture by the eyes are transmitted to the nerve cells. Therefore 
 it'D be possible to see with even a low resolution stimulation of the gagnliion cells
	furthermore, as there are around 120 million photoreceptors while only 1.5 million ganglion cells, **many photoreceptors converge onto a single bipolar cell especially at the periphery,** with further convergence taking place from the bipolar cells to RGCs (Kolb, 2003).
=> There's a massive complexity reduction of the amount of neuron. Especially at the periphery of the eyes, so that you don't really need to stim 120 millions photoreceptors to generate "phosphenes"

Conversely within the macular region of the retina, the photoreceptor:bipolar cell:RGC ratio approaches 1:1:1, with minimal convergence. It is thus envisaged that focal electrical stimulating patterns with a multi-electrode array in the macular region would more likely manifest retinotopic correlations along the visual pathway. There is, however, a particular limitation to this rationale, due to the arcuate displacement of axons and the piling up of ganglion cell bodies when approaching the fovea.  
=> It's better to stimulate at the macula because the PRcs are 1by1 linked to the RGCs

 

What percentage of people work well with the Argus?
	Ideal candidates for treatment would therefore have conditions where the outer retina (i.e. photoreceptors and/or retinal pigment epithelium) has been destroyed by any mechanism, while the inner retina (e.g. bipolar cells, RGCs, horizontal cells and amacrine cells) remains relatively intact

The perfect candidates are Retina Pigmentosa
	RP denotes a group of hereditary outer retinal dystrophies, affecting around 1 in 4000 live births and more than a million people worldwide (Hartong et al., 2006). Affected individuals suffer from progressive visual loss which can be profound (0.5% with no light perception and 25% with 20/200 vision in both eyes) (Grover et al., 1999).
=> The Argus works on eyes that have a destroyed outer layer but preserved inner. Therefore, we isolate the diseases that destroy photoreceptors but not RGCs.
This narrows the disease to: RP and AMD

## Argus components
There are 3 funciton a RP should be able to do: 
1. Capture the visual information
2. Transduc it into electrical stimuli
3. Activating  correctly the Retinal ganglion cells and BPcells (residual inner retina)
#retinalcochlea 
Its made of 3 external and 3 internal components: 

The 3 external componets of Argus are:
	1. . A glasses mounted video-camera e for real-time image capture.
	2.   A portable computer (the Visual Processing Unit, VPU) e for processing of the captured scenes and translation into electrical stimulating parameters conveying spatialetemporal information. 
	3. 3. An external coil (built into the side arm of the glasses) e for wireless transmission of the processed data from the VPU and electrical power to the internal components using radiofrequency (RF) telemetry.
The 3 external components are: 
	![[Pasted image 20220629085057.png]]
	1. An internal coil e as a wireless receiver of RF telemetry, converting radio waves back to electrical signals to recover both data and electrical power. 
	2. **2. An inbuilt Application-Specific-Integrated-Circuit (ASIC) e for generating appropriate electrical pulses in accordance with the stimulating parameter data recovered from the internal coil, which are then relayed to the multi-electrode array.** 
	 => what are the generated pulses?
	3. A 60-channel microelectrode (6 * 10) epiretinal array e consisting of 60 platinum electrodes (diameter ¼ 200 mm) spaced 575 mm (centre-to-centre) apart, embedded in a thin film of polyimide. Each microelectrode is connected to the ASIC in a parallel circuit via a metallised polymer connecting cable, **such that each electrode can be activated independently according to the stimulating parameters.** The array comes into direct contact with the retinal surface, allowing injection of electrical charge.
>The internal coil recieve the radio waves of the RF transmiter 
>The ASIC will generate the pulse to the microelectrode
>The electrod will stim the retinal surface

### HOW MUCH VISION IS REGAINED  
### 2.1. Proof of concept

The development of the Argus® II Retinal Prosthesis, as with all retinal prostheses, was based on the following assumptions:

1.The inner retina (RGCs with/without bipolar cells) of end-stage [RP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/retinitis-pigmentosa "Learn more about RP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") patients remains functionally intact for transmission of information along the [visual pathway](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/visual-pathway "Learn more about visual pathway from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to the [visual cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/visual-cortex "Learn more about visual cortex from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

2.The residual inner retina can be activated focally with localised [electrical stimulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/electro-stimulation "Learn more about electrical stimulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to elicit discrete phosphenes without causing damage or toxicity to the retina.

**3.[Retinotopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/retinotopy "Learn more about Retinotopy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is relatively preserved in the residual inner retina and along the visual pathway, such that simultaneous multi-focal stimulations would form geometric patterns of phosphenes in accordance with retinotopic locations.**
=> Unfortunately it's not


4.The elicited geometric patterns of phosphenes can be relayed in a spatio-temporally correct manner along the visual pathway and interpreted by the primary visual cortex as recognisable visual patterns.

5.Limited pixels can still provide useful visual function.

## HOW IT PULSES

We used a previously established hybrid threshold algorithm to determine the patient's perceptual threshold for individual electrodes [7]. To mimic stimulation generated by daily Argus II use, all electric stimuli were biphasic, charge-balanced, cathode-first current pulses. The pulse width was 0.45 ms/phase, applied for 250 ms at a pulse frequency of 20 Hz. We generated randomly distributed blocks of six electrodes to test in a series of one-hour sessions. Each session involved 300–400 trials. Each trial administered single-electrode stimulation at a pre-determined pulse amplitude, and the subject responded (verbal “yes”/“no”) based on whether a phosphene appeared.
=>This was a test to figure out if phosphenes would appear and at what type of stimulation. 
The hybrid algorithm continually generated new pulse amplitudes based on a Weibull distribution of previous responses. We randomized the order of active electrodes and included 32 catch (stimulus-absent) trials per block. Trials continued until the maximum likelihood function converged to 0.5 for each electrode, representing a current amplitude where a phosphene appears 50% of the time (Figure 2(a)). Using 50% percept probability to define visual perception threshold is standard in the field of artificial vision [7], [20], [21]. We tested five blocks, establishing perceptual thresholds for 30 electrodes. However, we disregarded one block due to a high false positive rate (>25% “yes” response for catch trials). Thresholds are shown in Figure 2(b) for the 24 eligible electrodes. Electrode impedance was also measured using the native Argus II hardware.

For silicon chronically implanted in the brain, the electrical conductivity of surrounding encapsulation tissue has been measured between 0.15 S/m and 0.37 S/m [24]. We performed a parameter sweep over this range to determine the fibrotic tissue conductivity that produced a model impedance at the center (C5) electrode that best matched with the patient's average electrode impedance.

### 3.2 Image processing
	![[Pasted image 20220711200958.png]]

### 3.4 Microelectrode array stimulation
There are three primary sites for placement of a retinal stimulating microelectrode array ([Figure 1](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#F1)): epiretinally (i.e. on the surface of the neurosensory retina), subretinally (i.e. between the retinal pigment epithelium and the degenerated outer retina) or suprachoroidally (i.e. between the sclera and the choroid). The advantage of the epiretinal placement is that the surgical approach is more familiar to vitreoretinal surgeons, allowing safer and easier implantation, adjustment and removal of devices. Furthermore, the interface with the vitreous cavity seems to permit safer heat dispersion. This set-up may be disadvantageous due to the fact that, in order to stimulate the RGCs, the stimulating current must pass through the retinal nerve fibre layer, which may produce ectopic visual percepts elsewhere in the retinotopic map.

Finally, suprachoroidal devices require a less invasive surgical procedure, which lends itself to easier repair or removal, but trials to date have been complicated by subchoroidal haemorrhage and fibrosis [[52](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B52)]. Due to the distance from the RGCs, these systems tend to require higher stimulation thresholds, leading to greater current dispersion and lowering the achievable SR. Overall, it seems that epiretinal and subretinal approaches have a superior performance in safety and efficacy to suprachoroidal implants. However, with pros and cons to both approaches, there is currently no clear evidence to suggest that, of these latter two, one system offers an overall advantage.

The challenge of electrode size and density is primarily a biological one, in as far as the native PR cells change in type, size, density and downstream signalling depending on their role and location in the retina. For example, cone PRs are, on average 6 μm in diameter, but in the centre of the fovea, they are around 1.5 μm in diameter and densely packed to permit the high resolution of vision that humans usually enjoy [[53](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B53)]. If we consider that normal vision is 20/20, meaning that the minimal angle of resolution at the retina is 1 arcminute, or the spatial frequency (SF) is 60 cycles per degree (cpd), then the SF required to achieve 20/200 (the approximate level of visual impairment) is 6 cpd. Since each degree angle subtended at the human retina is represented by ~280 μm, a SF of 6 cpd would necessitate a maximum pixel size of about 50 μm and, in turn an electrode size and pitch of 25 μm [[54](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B54), [55](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B55)]. Therefore, before factors such as electrode contact, dissipation of electrical current or heat are even considered, there is a significant theoretical constraint on the scale of manufacturing required to achieve a resolution corresponding to a visual acuity of 20/200.
=> You

The Argus II device has 200 μm electrodes separated by 525 μm, which suggests a theoretical maximum VA of 20/1600. The best result, with grating acuity, has been reported as 20/1262 (just over 1 cpd) with this system [[57](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B57)].
=> Electrode seperation

Size, shape and contact of the electrode at the tissue interface are all important considerations to improve SR, but also have implications to the charge density per unit area. As the electrode size becomes smaller, there is an exponential increase in concentration of the current, which can result in target tissue damage [[59](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B59)]
=> The current applied on retina increase as we decrease the electrode surface, so we can decrease it too much. 
Therefore there is an onus on finding materials that can permit the charge-injection requirements of neural stimulation, while minimizing conduction of heat or inducing tissue degradation. In addition to this, they must be biocompatible, waterproof and remain operational over an extended lifespan. While the precise electrochemical properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface, the capacitance and charge injection limits of different electrode materials is beyond the scope of this chapter, it is worth noting that new technologies, such as nanocoating, nanotubes and conductive polymers are providing promising developments in electrode fabrication
### 4.3 Safety outcomes

=>What can those MF do with that?

https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090
--------------------------------------------------
Simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) studies have been undertaken to try and estimate the optimum spatiotemporal image processing techniques for specific task completion, as well as the basic hardware requirements to best deliver RGC stimulation patterns [[13](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B13), [14](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B14), [15](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B15), [16](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B16), [17](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B17)]. SPV studies have extensively investigated the spatial resolution, visual field and contrast required for assorted activities of daily living, concluding that a minimum resolution of ~600–1000 pixels over a visual field 15° × 15° can permit reasonable accuracy in manipulation, recognition, orientation and mobility tasks. The resolution of around 3 pixels/degree2 is similar to that in some currently available photovoltaic retinal prosthetic systems while fields of at least 15° × 15° have been created. However, and disappointingly, there remains a mismatch in the functional aptitude demonstrated by subjects in SPV studies and that in recipients of visual prostheses. This suggests that other factors, such as the effects of behavioural adaptation, perceptual learning and cortical plasticity, as well as the loss of the intrinsic retinal processing capacity, could be critical requisites in the development of a visual restorative system that could deliver appreciable functional value [[18](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B18), [19](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B19)].

 It has been demonstrated that outer retinal degenerative disease results in a cascade of reorganization and remodelling within the retina and central nervous system, even taking place before there is clinical evidence of PR loss [20]
 => The Retina's topology changes after loss of vision. It remodels, dies, which makes it hard to encode visual data.
 (https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B20), [21](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B21), [22](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B22), [23](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B23), [24](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B24)]. A stepwise deterioration culminates in extensive neuronal cell migration, rewiring and death, accompanied by glial hypertrophy and retinal remodelling, rendering the retina incapable of processing or encoding visual data. This neuronal plasticity carries implications for all forms of visually restorative therapy, but particularly for prostheses, which are currently introduced at a late stage of visual impairment, where there has already been widespread reorganization with limited scope for rescuing vision. However, it may be that future iterations of bionic devices could even be introduced earlier in tthe disease process in an attempt to halt or reverse the remodelling process.
 
Another matter that remains unclear is the extent to which the human brain undergoes reorganization following loss of visual sensory input. Both animal and human studies have shown that there is the capacity for neuroplasticity as a functional adaptation to loss of a sensory modality [[25](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B25), [26](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B26), [27](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B27)]. For example, visual cortical activity has been demonstrated in blind subjects while reading Braille [[28](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B28), [29](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B29)]. Other studies of patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery, have shown correlation between the pre-operative auditory organization and activation and subsequent success of the neuroprosthesis [[30](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B30), [31](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/66090#B31)]. If a method could be developed by which a patient could be assessed for the feasibility of generating interpretable phosphenes, this would enhance patient selection and thus outcomes in this area of visual restoration. Further understanding of the nature of cortical plasticity in sensory loss and how subjects can adapt to a new form of vision with perceptual learning and rehabilitation, is sure to enhance the beneficial effect of visual restorative treatments in the future.

Each of the 60 electrodes (in a 6 × 10 grid) were 200 μm in diameter and were made of platinum gray, a high surface-area platinum developed by Second Sight Medical Products (US Patent no. 6 974 533). The array (along the diagonal) covered an area of retina corresponding to about 20° in visual angle, assuming 293 μm on the retina equates to 1° of visual angle.[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/1375731#ref-ecs120052-6)

Stimulation parameters were chosen such that they maximized the subject's performance on previous assessments during the clinical trial, while remaining within the safety and technical limits of the system. Stimulation parameters used for all subjects were charge-balanced cathodic-first pulses with a pulse width of 0.46 milliseconds, except for a single subject (61-001), who used settings with a pulse width of 0.97 milliseconds. The pulse frequency was fixed for each subject, ranging from 3 Hz to 60 Hz.

https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2188619
---------------------------------------------------------------
he DS array of 4 × 4 hardwired microelectrodes (titanium nitride, TiN) in a rectangular grid with a spacing of 280 μm (Fig. 1a) is used for light-independent, direct stimulation of the retina. This array was modified during the course of the study to increase the safe charge injection capacity of the electrodes: In first-generation implants 50 × 50-μm electrodes (S1–S8; Fig. 1b) were used and in second-generation implants, 100 × 100-μm electrodes (one electrode consisting of four 50-μm electrodes close together owing to the production process; S9–12, compare Fig. 1c). The electrodes are driven monopolarly, with one large return electrode subcutaneously placed near the orbital rim. The implant is connected to a battery-driven stimulus generator via a percutaneous cable (Fig. 1d). It employs a single constant voltage source that can route one stimulation voltage to an arbitrary combination of electrodes. Therefore, in concurrent stimulation of multiple electrodes, differences in thresholds between electrodes could not be accounted for. Amplitude (0–2.3 V), pulse duration (0.5–6 ms), and pulse shape (square-wave anodic or cathodic first, biphasic, or monophasic) can be adjusted. Each electrode is grounded after stimulation, to allow for charge balance.
=>The duration of the pulse of each electrode can vary from 0.5 to 6ms and it delivers square wave, bi or monophasic. 
![[Pasted image 20220714141247.png]]

. Single pulses of 0.5- to 6-ms duration and the four pulse forms were tested in separate sessions. Generally, single biphasic pulses with a duration of 2 to 3 ms yielded the best reproducible thresholds. Transferred charge at threshold was typically in the range of 20 to 60-nC per phase. 26  
	=> Usually the best is 2-3ms SBiphasid pulse. This create a current around 50nC for each phase which is bearable for the cells. The best ISI IPI that helps still recognize stuff are around 200ms

The stimulation parameters were tested only for influence on thresholds (Wilke R, et al. _IOVS_ 2010;51:ARVO E-Abstract 2026), not for the perception of patterns. All psychophysical tests were performed by using the stimulation setting with the lowest thresholds, and single-pulse stimulation was applied, so that the participants saw a certain pattern only once for a brief time. 

Psychophysical Tests and Statistics

After an initial phase for finding the optimal stimulation parameter and a brief learning phase, all psychophysical tests were performed employing an alternative forced choice scheme. 44 Reported results include the chance rate and the _P_ value calculated from the binomial function. Although the chance rate depends only on the number of choices given, the _P_ value also depends on the number of trials and indicates the probability of obtaining the respective hit rate or a higher one by guessing. Results with _P_ < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The sequence within individual tests was randomized. Results are summed from tests of multiple sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### 2.4.3.2. Selective stimulation and waveform

Various stimulation strategies aimed to improve the temporal and spatial profiles of the retinal response have been studied. Selective activation of bipolar cells and ganglion cells is possible by altering the stimulus waveforms ([Freeman et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib53), [Fried et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib55), [Margalit and Thoreson, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib118)). Retinal ganglion cells are more susceptible to short duration pulses (<150 μs) whereas inner retinal neurons favor longer pulse width. Bipolar cells are preferentially activated by sinusoidal stimulus at 25 Hz and ganglion cells at 100 Hz, thus rectangular waveforms employed by the retinal prostheses are likely to activate both cell types ([Freeman et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib53)). Within the ganglion cell population, specific activation of single ON and OFF parasol cells was initially accounted by [Sekirnjak et al. (2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib166), using small electrodes (9–15 μm diameter) and short duration (0.05–0.1 ms) biphasic stimulation. With similar approach, localized activation of ON and OFF midget cells and bistratified retinal ganglion cells was achieved, but at only ∼50% of the time, due to the unwanted axonal activation ([Jepson et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib85)). It remains a challenge to preferentially activate specific ganglion cell populations by variations in the waveforms alone, if not taking into account the spatial factors such as electrode size. [Jensen and Rizzo (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib83) found that, in subretinal stimulation, ON and OFF cells exhibited [differential thresholds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/differential-threshold "Learn more about differential thresholds from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for anodic-leading current pulses but not for cathodic-leading pulses, possibly unveiling a mechanism for the targeted stimulation of ON and OFF signaling pathways.
=> Eventhough most cells respond to stimuli, they don't do that in the same ways. Some evidences from [] show that Inner cells react better too longer pulse width compared to RGCs. For the Bipolar cells, in between RGCs and PRcs, a good sinusoidal 25-100Hz works best
=>
##### 2.4.3.3. Stimulation efficiency and waveform

Changes in the stimulus waveforms influence the stimulation efficiency. Addition of an [interphase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/interphase "Learn more about interphase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") gap between the leading cathodic phase and the following anodic phase has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing electrical stimulation thresholds for the epiretinal Argus II prosthesis ([Weitz et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib201)). Enhanced brightness of the phosphenes can be achieved by increasing either the amplitude or the frequency of the stimulation, but the latter allows for the maintenance of the phosphene size ([Nanduri et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib132)). The working frequency of the subretinal Alpha IMS implant is typically set at 5–20 Hz, though some patients preferred a lower frequency to prevent phosphene fading ([Stingl et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib178)). [Freeman and Fried (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib54) proposed a fade-resistant strategy that consists of longer duration desensitizing pulses (1 ms) interspersed in the short duration stimulating pulse trains. The desensitizing pulses, expected to diminish the synaptically mediated response, are continuously delivered independent of luminance. The effectiveness of this strategy is not experimentally validated yet.

#### 2.4.5. Stimulation encoding
These 20 separate mosaics are interwoven over the entire retina, oftentimes with overlapping receptive fields, and each extracts a distinct feature of the image flow, such as luminance, contrast, shape, color and motion. Outputs of these mosaics are carried to the higher visual centers in the brain each via a specific ganglion cell channel, encoded by the spatiotemporal patterns of spiking ([da Silveira and Roska, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib34), [Trenholm and Roska, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#bib186)). In the presence of the same visual stimuli, these anatomically distinct ganglion cell types are known to exhibit differential responses that are integrated and decoded by the cortex to generate sense of vision. Therefore a stimulation algorithm that incorporates the firing patterns specific to each mosaic has the potential to produce retinal outputs more readily interpretable to the cortex
=> 
Due to various constraints on the electrode size as discussed in Section [2.4.1.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946216300271?casa_token=Vi1M1Ddhi_YAAAAA:xLwovbsaX_tVLT-dxvRSbA4hiZ-tmzFPIpmuQtBmWJoa1PujnFccMy0sLfFjNrYXTVCCUO7sWg#sec2.4.1.1), current devices only allow simultaneous activation of multiple cell populations. 
EXEMPLE:
Earlier electrophysiological studies have predicted primate ganglion cell responses by a linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade model with a difference-of-Gaussians or wavelet-shaped characteristic spatial profile

### retinal degeneration
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the patients with [macular degeneration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/macular-degeneration "Learn more about macular degeneration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") indicates that part of the cortex that normally responds to foveal visual inputs are strongly activated by the peripheral stimuli, confirming some level of neuroplasiticity in visually deprived cortex
But other studies with PET scans suggest otherwise

Hence, the functionality of present-day implants is not determined by limitations in in the number or density of the electrodes. Instead, factors such as the electrode-tissue interface [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R31), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R32), severity of retinal degeneration and rewiring [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R33), cortical remodeling [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R34)], and psychological factors such as the patient’s preparedness for an intensive rehabilitation process [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R35)] may be more important. Indeed, cochlear implants, which have been available for decades [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R36)], were shown to perform almost equally well in terms of speech understanding when the number of channels was reduced from 20 to 7 [[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R37)]. As a consequence, cochlear implant engineering has mainly shifted its focus towards optimizing stimulation strategies, rather than maximizing electrode densities (e.g. [[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R38), [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R39)]). Although spatial resolution may be more important in retinal implants, we expect a similar trend to occur where much of the engineering efforts will go into improving image processing, such as the implementation of feature extraction paradigms where objects of interest such as edges [[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R40)] or obstacles [[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R41)] are overrepresented in the image to maximize the information contained in sparse stimuli. Optimizing the electrode-tissue interface and improved patient screening are two other aspects where much can be gained in the near future.

Acute studies in blind RP patients, using hand-held probes in the operating room, have shown that retinotopy is maintained with single-point stimuli, that phosphenes separated by as little as 0.75° could be successfully discerned, and that 2/3 of the subjects could identify the direction of motion of an electrode moved across the retina [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926652/#R1)].

The independent assessment team recorded that 80% of patients had benefited in their functional vision and/or quality of life at 1-year post implantation, and none experienced negative effects.[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/eye201765#ref-CR58 "Ho AC, Humayun MS, Dorn JD, Da Cruz L, Dagnelie G, Handa J et al. Long-term results from an epiretinal prosthesis to restore sight to the blind. Ophthalmology 2015; 122 (8): 1547–1554.") This positive effect has recently been shown to be maintained at 3 years post implantation.[56](https://www.nature.com/articles/eye201765#ref-CR56 "Handa J Safety and Performance Results of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System Five Years Post-Implant. 39th Annual Macula Society Meeting 2016.") This is comparable to a statistically significant improvement in ADL recorded by the research group in 72% of patients implanted with the Alpha-IMS, however, 8 of 29 patients did not experience benefit from the implant in daily life.[60](https://www.nature.com/articles/eye201765#ref-CR60 "Stingl K, Bartz-Schmidt KU, Besch D, Chee CK, Cottriall CL, Gekeler F et al.

Better visual performance was recorded in all three tasks in 89%, 56% and 33% of patients, respectively, with Argus II system turned on, at 3 years post implantation. Independent assessment by a rehabilitation specialist of the impact of the device on quality of life (using the Functional Low-vision Observer Rated Assessment (or FLORA, based on both assessors and patients opinions’ of benefit) stated that 80% of the patients had received benefit in their functional vision and/or well-being at 1-year post implantation. FLORA involved an in depth interview and observation of patients in a real-world environment at home. For those subjects who had a measurable visual acuity with the Argus II, the Grating Visual Acuity logMAR measurements had a mean of 2.5 at 1 year and 2.5 at 3 years, suggesting that the visual improvement is sustained over a medium-term.58 Furthermore, 5-year results report that increase in visual function is maintained long-term despite two devices failing at 4 years post implantation.56

Arsiero et al. demonstrated, among implanted subjects, recognition of eight simple, solid, white shapes on a black background was significantly better the device on (31%) than off (13%), which improved further to 57% when the shapes were presented as outlines [79]. Luo et al. built upon this, presenting seven implanted subjects with eight high-contrast everyday items, both in the solid and outlined forms. It was found that subjects could identify solid objects to the same degree of accuracy with the device on as they could with the device on in the scrambled mode. Although superior to having the device off, this suggested that subjects were relying on visual cues other than the form presented but the array stimulation pattern. When the shapes were presented in their outlined forms, this significantly improved performance with the
