Even though there's 1/4 billion with blind symptom only 500 are equiped with RP
	In 2015, there were 253 million individuals (3.43% of global population) blind and moderately-to-severely visually impaired people in the world ([Bourne et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B15)). By 2050, owing to a dramatic increase in life expectancy, it is predicted that this number will rise to 703 million (7.19% of global population) ([Bourne et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B15)). Blindness is the most feared condition by the American public, more so than Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS ([Scott et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B130)). Visual deficits are strongly associated with economic ([Wittenborn et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B156)), physical ([McLean et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B102); [Crews, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B39)), and emotional ([Stelmack, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B138); [Hassell et al., 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B63)) detriments. While population aging is still in its early stages, large-scale communities and nations are already being challenged by the increased medical and fiscal responsibilities associated with visual impairments ([Gordois et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B59); [Wittenborn et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B156)). In fact, the majority of public health specialists have underestimated the rapidity of this epidemiological transition and the associated need for resource reallocation ([World Health Organization, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B158)). Thus, it is necessary to identify new interventions to address the steep increase of visual deficits among the world population.


## Electrode-Based Visual Prostheses

- It matters that we create the interface at a certain part of the visual pathway. Too early and the signal will be corrupted. Too late and you need to apply algo to process the signal
	 Interfacing too early along the visual pathway could lead to either non-transmitted or significantly corrupted and unintelligible signals. Interfacing at a region later than necessary bypasses functional neuronal circuitry, requiring additional hardware and/or complex image-processing algorithms.

### Retinal
In the fovea, the most visually acute portion of the retina, there are an average of 150,000 ([Shroff, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B134)) and a peak density of 200,000 cone photoreceptors per mm2 ([Curcio et al., 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B40)). The diameters of cone outer segments and retinal ganglion cells are 3–5 μm and 6–13 μm, respectively ([Hebel and Holländer, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B64); [Shepherd, 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B132)). Although improvements in micromachining and lithography now allow for the development of precise electrode arrays, targeting each neuron independently to reproduce natural vision is still challenging. Fortunately, extrapolating from cochlear implant patients, functional vision restoration most likely requires a total electrode count that is a mere fraction of the number of retinal neurons. Moreover, patients have been observed to demonstrate a significant learning effect and task-based improvements shortly after implantation.
- retinal implants as the most common visual prostheses due to the orderly retinotopic organization, ease of surgical accessibility, and early positioning in the visual pathway. Two retinal prostheses sub-types, subretinal and epiretinal, constitute the majority of retinal prostheses-based research.
