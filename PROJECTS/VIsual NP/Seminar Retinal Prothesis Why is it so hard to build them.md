The central question to elucidate is: What keeps Retinal Prosthetics from working

1. Why aren't they as good as chochlear implant. 
2. What makes it challenging to build them
3. What are the different approaches that exist to build them

What problem do retinal implants solve? (show the eye, and show the pieces where they can be destroyed)
1. 
2. 
- Those diseases don't apply to a very big percentage of the population so don't really help a lot of people
- Only 200 patients for the Argus for example
