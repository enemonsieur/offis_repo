The central question to elucidate is: What keeps Retinal Prosthetics from working

1. Why aren't they as good as chochlear implant. 
2. What makes it challenging to build them
3. What are the different approaches that exist to build them

What problem do retinal implants solve? (show the eye, and show the pieces where they can be destroyed)
1. 
2. 
- Those diseases don't apply to a very big percentage of the population so don't really help a lot of people
- Only 200 patients for the Argus for example
- But people have been 
- Talk about how vision works: Receptive Field activation, need excitatory and inh signals. 
Vision is the most important of our senses. People say it may take up to 80% of our perception and indeed, most of the studies on sensory modality have been done of vision. 
Look at the auditory diagram. If there's [700K cochlear implants ](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants#:~:text=Children%20and%20adults%20who%20are,adults%20and%2065%2C000%20in%20children.)wordlwide, just imagine how much retinal implants exists: Do a fake diagram comparing CI andRI: 50000 RI. Only 50K implants... sorry. Wait what? That can be so low... Oh. Sorry . I actually mixed the slides. Here's the real number... [500 patients in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198351/#:~:text=There%20have%20now%20been%20three,over%20the%20past%2015%20years.) 2020 . 1% of the CI have been installed worldwide. 
How could there be such a discrepancy between the obsession with vision and the visual technology?
