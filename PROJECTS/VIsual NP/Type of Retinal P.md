### Type of retinal Implant

#retinal When do Retinal Pr. comes in handy? Contrarily to Cochlear implants, RP isn't ubiquituos: Many reasons can explain why someone loss the vision. People can have a stroke in the V1 area, or because of cataract. All of which can't be solve by RI. There are two know diseases that can be habdle by RP and those are  [retinitis pigmentosa +++ which is a severe form of retinal degeneration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/)
>RP is a genetically heterogeneous group of diseases, which include rod-cone dystrophies, Usher’s syndrome, and Leber’s congenital amaurosis.


Specifically, the rodes and cones phtooreceptors start to degenrate, and the patient loose the ability to see. They retinal cells start to degenerate, app. 30% which then  makes it hard for the RP to stimulate the visual nerve. This introduce another challenge, which is pretty similar to Cochlear implant: [Will the patient have enough nerves cells alive to benefit from the NP?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/)
	Since all retinal prostheses rely on the presence of functioning retinal ganglion cells, prosthetic candidates are often evaluated for ganglion cell function using a corneal stimulation electrode to induce electrically-evoked phosphenes termed the “electrically-evoked response” (EER) ([24-26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). Currently, there are two main classes of retinal prostheses: electrical and optogenetic.

After identifying suitable patients, with suffisient Nerves left, you have to find the appropriate devices: You can stimulate the nerves via electricity or optogenetics. 

### Retinal prostheses using electrical stimulation
![[Pasted image 20220627172932.png]]
They can be  subretinal, epiretinal , suprachoroidal or in the optic nerve
#### Epiretinal 
In the inner limiting membrane
	The array is connected by a cable to the stimulator case and coil, which is sutured on the outside of the globe, and held in place by scleral bands. Telemetry coils mounted on the arm of the patient’s camera glasses deliver wireless power and data signals to the implant coil. A pocket visual processor/battery unit allows user-selectable viewing modes. The first epiretinal prosthesis in a clinical trial, the Argus I used a modified cochlear implant stimulator and had a 4 x 4 array of 250-500µm diameter platinum (Pt) epiretinal electrodes ([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). For visual scale of electrode size at the retina, 1 degree visual angle is about 280µm on the retina. This is the visual field size of the nail of the index finger held at arm’s length ([28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). Other early epiretinal prosthesis designs clinically tested included the Epi-Ret ([29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)) and the IMI retinal implant ([30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). The “Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System” is currently the only retinal prosthesis legally marketed in the U.S. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 as a humanitarian use device, and was CE marked (EU) in 2011.

The RP places an electrode on the Inner Limiting Membrane of the retina which gets then stimulated.
#retinatype The advantage is that it doesn't really damage the retina
Because the electrode current really spreads out, it will stimulate both ON and OFF ganglion cells Which 
####  Subretinal electrode prostheses
Subretinal prostheses place electrode arrays in the subretinal space between the pigment epithelium and the degenerate photoreceptor layer ([Figure 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F5/?report=objectonly))
This places the stimulus electrodes in close proximity to activate the remaining bipolar and amacrine cells of the blind patient, which theoretically could excite the remaining retinal circuitry in a more natural fashion than epiretinal prostheses

 **. We will examine 3 shortcomings of current retinal implants: the fundamental reorganization of the degenerated retina, the inability to stimulate at the scale of the target cells, and the need to fine-tune stimulation by recording from the implanted electrodes. #retinalcochlea** 


AVANTAGE OF subretinal e-protheses
	The advantage of subretinal prostheses is that their electrodes stimulate the remaining neurons of the outer retina such as the bipolar cells. This could provide a more coordinated visual circuitry activation in blind patients, which would propagate through the retinal network

Even though there's 1/4 billion with blind symptom only 500 are equiped with RP
	In 2015, there were 253 million individuals (3.43% of global population) blind and moderately-to-severely visually impaired people in the world ([Bourne et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B15)). By 2050, owing to a dramatic increase in life expectancy, it is predicted that this number will rise to 703 million (7.19% of global population) ([Bourne et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B15)). Blindness is the most feared condition by the American public, more so than Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS ([Scott et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B130)). Visual deficits are strongly associated with economic ([Wittenborn et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B156)), physical ([McLean et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B102); [Crews, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B39)), and emotional ([Stelmack, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B138); [Hassell et al., 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B63)) detriments. While population aging is still in its early stages, large-scale communities and nations are already being challenged by the increased medical and fiscal responsibilities associated with visual impairments ([Gordois et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B59); [Wittenborn et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B156)). In fact, the majority of public health specialists have underestimated the rapidity of this epidemiological transition and the associated need for resource reallocation ([World Health Organization, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B158)). Thus, it is necessary to identify new interventions to address the steep increase of visual deficits among the world population.


## Electrode-Based Visual Prostheses

- It matters that we create the interface at a certain part of the visual pathway. Too early and the signal will be corrupted. Too late and you need to apply algo to process the signal
	 Interfacing too early along the visual pathway could lead to either non-transmitted or significantly corrupted and unintelligible signals. Interfacing at a region later than necessary bypasses functional neuronal circuitry, requiring additional hardware and/or complex image-processing algorithms.

### Retinal
In the fovea, the most visually acute portion of the retina, there are an average of 150,000 ([Shroff, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B134)) and a peak density of 200,000 cone photoreceptors per mm2 ([Curcio et al., 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B40)). The diameters of cone outer segments and retinal ganglion cells are 3–5 μm and 6–13 μm, respectively ([Hebel and Holländer, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B64); [Shepherd, 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B132)). Although improvements in micromachining and lithography now allow for the development of precise electrode arrays, targeting each neuron independently to reproduce natural vision is still challenging. Fortunately, extrapolating from cochlear implant patients, functional vision restoration most likely requires a total electrode count that is a mere fraction of the number of retinal neurons. Moreover, patients have been observed to demonstrate a significant learning effect and task-based improvements shortly after implantation.
- retinal implants as the most common visual prostheses due to the orderly retinotopic organization, ease of surgical accessibility, and early positioning in the visual pathway. Two retinal prostheses sub-types, subretinal and epiretinal, constitute the majority of retinal prostheses-based research.
- #### Subretinal
 Since they interact with outer-retinal tissue, subretinal prostheses retain substantial intra-retinal signal processing. This allows for the generation of more naturalistic phosphenes, serving to expedite patient training periods relative to other types of visual prostheses.
 Subretinal prostheses allow for the earliest possible intervention in the visual process. 
 A 1500 pixel MPDA
	  (Some subretinal implants even do away with the need for an external imager altogether via the use of microphotodiode arrays (MPDAs).)
 subretinal implant offers visual acuity restoration up to 20/546 ([Stingl et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B140)), roughly translating to such real-world abilities as identification of office supplies and distinguishing between kitchen cutlery ([Stingl et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B139)).
	  Some patients are even able to differentiate between large alphabet letters and combine them into words ([Zrenner et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B161); [Stingl et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B140)). A recent study incorporated a 378-pixel array, achieving the highest visual acuity to date: 20/460. Additional testing of letter recognition and reading has already shown promising preliminary results ([Palanker et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B112)). Since MPDAs rely upon light transmittal through the cornea and lens, those with conditions that obscure light passage would not be eligible for such implants.

 The uneven photoreceptor density within the retina presents a major challenge. Since the density of cone photoreceptors decreases with increasing retinal eccentricity, uniform phosphene generation throughout the visual field would require MEAs with varying electrode diameters and inter-electrode spacing. Novel MEA designs that promote glial and neuronal migration may allow for lower stimulation levels and more densely packed arrays ([Butterwick et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B22); [Spira and Hai, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B136)). #retinalcochlea 
 **It is positioned within the largely degenerated photoreceptor layer and directly interface with retinal bipolar cells.** Since they interact with outer-retinal tissue, subretinal prostheses retain substantial intra-retinal signal processing.
=>They directly stimulate the photoreceptors so may not even need transduction to electric current. The downside is that the eye has to be permeable to light.

#### Epiretinal

Epiretinal prostheses interact with retinal ganglion cells. Owing to their downstream placement, epiretinal prostheses have a wider therapeutic potential than subretinal prostheses.

 Epiretinal arrays can even selectively stimulate ganglion cells or bipolar cells based on stimulation parameters, including pulse polarity and duration ([Boinagrov et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B12)). Optimization of these features can reduce functional threshold levels, thus allowing for smaller electrode-diameters and denser MEAs before surpassing physiological safety limits. The implants are located adjacent to the spacious vitreous humor. This allows for larger electrical componentry and mitigates electrically-induced heat absorption by nearby tissue. However, unlike subretinal MEAs that are held in place by the underlying retinal pigment epithelium
Currently there is an FDA-approved retinal prostheses ([Luo and Da Cruz, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B97)) which consists of a 60-electrode epiretinal device that has yielded patient improvements in spatial motor tasks ([Ahuja et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B2)), motion detection ([da Cruz et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B42)), and letter-reading performance ([Da Cruz et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B41)).

### Optic Nerve
Borrowing from peripheral-nerve stimulation technology ([Mortimer et al., 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B106)), self-sizing cuff electrodes with four equidistant 200 μm2 contacts have been implanted around the optic nerve of a human patient ([Veraart et al., 1998](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B149)). By varying stimulation parameters, such as pulse duration and pulse train frequency optic nerve prostheses can elicit phosphene clusters of different sizes and in various locations ([Veraart et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B150); [Brelén et al., 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B17)).
Such prostheses, however, are restricted to serial stimulation ([Brelén et al., 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B17)) and lack adjustable phosphene luminosity ([Delbeke et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B46)), a feature positively correlated with performance scores on object discrimination tasks. The surface-based electrode contacts also increase current injection thresholds and reduce nerve fiber selectivity – the 1.2 million, 1-μm diameter optic nerve fibers already makes targeting specific points in the visual field extremely challenging ([Jonas et al., 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B74)). In an effort to enhance fiber selectivity, penetrating electrode arrays have been inserted into the optic nerve. These MEAs can elicit cortical responses in animal models ([Chai et al., 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B31); [Li et al., 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B88); [Lu et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B96); [Gaillet et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B57)) and one penetrating array, with wire electrodes progressing through the optic disk and into the optic nerve, has been implanted in a human patient ([Sakaguchi et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B126)). Similar to retinal prostheses, optic nerve prostheses, both surface-based and penetrating, benefit from a relatively less invasive intraocular surgery.


### Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)
At the optic chiasm, optic nerve fibers associated with the nasal half of each retina decussate and project to contralateral subcortical structures. Ninety percent of the retinal ganglion axons synapse at the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus ([Kandel et al., 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B78)). An LGN prostheses has rehabilitative potential for individuals with either retinal or optic nerve pathologies.
Unlike the retina, LGN receptive fields have a consistent spatial density regardless of their visual field eccentricity. Since 60% of the LGN volume is devoted to processing the central 3° of the visual field ([Schneider et al., 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B129)), lower-density MEAs could be used, reducing tissue damage due to mechanical insertion or electrical current delivery.

### Cortex

One of the most important features of cortical prostheses is the downstream location. This offers rehabilitative potential for blind and visually-impaired individuals for which a retinal, optic nerve or LGN visual prostheses would be ineffective ([Gabel, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B56)). Furthermore, cortical implants have the longest window for therapeutic intervention; instead of total neural degeneration, post-injury compensatory plasticity mechanisms recruit deafferented neurons from other cortical regions, offering the possibility of stimulation well beyond the onset of injury or disease ([Sadato et al., 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B125); [Pietrini et al., 2004](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B117)). After the LGN, the optic radiations transmit signals to layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1). Neurons with similar receptive fields are organized into 1 mm2 columns, which can be further subdivided into smaller columns responsive to orientation axis, color and ocular dominance. Similar to the LGN, these columns maintain a fairly consistent spatial density across the surface of V1 owing to the cortical magnification of central visual field
