### Type of retinal Implant

#retinal When do Retinal Pr. comes in handy? Contrarily to Cochlear implants, RP isn't ubiquituos: Many reasons can explain why someone loss the vision. People can have a stroke in the V1 area, or because of cataract. All of which can't be solve by RI. There are two know diseases that can be habdle by RP and those are  [retinitis pigmentosa +++ which is a severe form of retinal degeneration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/)
>RP is a genetically heterogeneous group of diseases, which include rod-cone dystrophies, Usher’s syndrome, and Leber’s congenital amaurosis.


Specifically, the rodes and cones phtooreceptors start to degenrate, and the patient loose the ability to see. They retinal cells start to degenerate, app. 30% which then  makes it hard for the RP to stimulate the visual nerve. This introduce another challenge, which is pretty similar to Cochlear implant: [Will the patient have enough nerves cells alive to benefit from the NP?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/)
	Since all retinal prostheses rely on the presence of functioning retinal ganglion cells, prosthetic candidates are often evaluated for ganglion cell function using a corneal stimulation electrode to induce electrically-evoked phosphenes termed the “electrically-evoked response” (EER) ([24-26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). Currently, there are two main classes of retinal prostheses: electrical and optogenetic.

After identifying suitable patients, with suffisient Nerves left, you have to find the appropriate devices: You can stimulate the nerves via electricity or optogenetics. 

### Retinal prostheses using electrical stimulation

They can be  subretinal, epiretinal , suprachoroidal or in the optic nerve
#### Epiretinal 
In the inner limiting membrane
	The array is connected by a cable to the stimulator case and coil, which is sutured on the outside of the globe, and held in place by scleral bands. Telemetry coils mounted on the arm of the patient’s camera glasses deliver wireless power and data signals to the implant coil. A pocket visual processor/battery unit allows user-selectable viewing modes. The first epiretinal prosthesis in a clinical trial, the Argus I used a modified cochlear implant stimulator and had a 4 x 4 array of 250-500µm diameter platinum (Pt) epiretinal electrodes ([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). For visual scale of electrode size at the retina, 1 degree visual angle is about 280µm on the retina. This is the visual field size of the nail of the index finger held at arm’s length ([28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). Other early epiretinal prosthesis designs clinically tested included the Epi-Ret ([29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)) and the IMI retinal implant ([30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/#)). The “Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System” is currently the only retinal prosthesis legally marketed in the U.S. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 as a humanitarian use device, and was CE marked (EU) in 2011.

The RP places an electrode on the Inner Limiting Membrane of the retina which gets then stimulated.
#retinatype The advantage is that it doesn't really damage the retina
Because the electrode current really spreads out, it will stimulate both ON and OFF ganglion cells Which 
####  Subretinal electrode prostheses
Subretinal prostheses place electrode arrays in the subretinal space between the pigment epithelium and the degenerate photoreceptor layer ([Figure 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493746/figure/RetinalProthesis.F5/?report=objectonly))
This places the stimulus electrodes in close proximity to activate the remaining bipolar and amacrine cells of the blind patient, which theoretically could excite the remaining retinal circuitry in a more natural fashion than epiretinal prostheses

 the fundamental reorganization of the degenerated retina, the inability to stimulate at the scale of the target cells, and the need to fine-tune stimulation by recording from the implanted electrodes.
 . We will examine 3 shortcomings of current retinal implants: the fundamental reorganization of the degenerated retina, the inability to stimulate at the scale of the target cells, and the need to fine-tune stimulation by recording from the implanted electrodes. #retinalcochlea 


AVANTAGE OF subretinal e-protheses
	The advantage of subretinal prostheses is that their electrodes stimulate the remaining neurons of the outer retina such as the bipolar cells. This could provide a more coordinated visual circuitry activation in blind patients, which would propagate through the retinal network
