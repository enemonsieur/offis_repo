The central question to elucidate is: What keeps Retinal Prosthetics from working

1. Why aren't they as good as chochlear implant. 
2. What makes it challenging to build them
3. What are the different approaches that exist to build them

What problem do retinal implants solve? (show the eye, and show the pieces where they can be destroyed)
1. AMD
2. RP
- Those diseases don't apply to a very big percentage of the population so don't really help a lot of people
- Only 200 patients for the Argus for example
- But people have been 
- Talk about how vision works: Receptive Field activation, need excitatory and inhibitory signals. 
Vision is the most important of our senses. People say it may take up to 80% of our perception and indeed, most of the studies on sensory modality have been done of vision. 
Look at the auditory diagram. If there's [700K cochlear implants ](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants#:~:text=Children%20and%20adults%20who%20are,adults%20and%2065%2C000%20in%20children.)wordlwide, just imagine how much retinal implants exists: Do a fake diagram comparing CI andRI: 50000 RI. Only 50K implants... sorry. Wait what? That can be so low... Oh. Sorry . I actually mixed the slides. Here's the real number... [500 patients in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198351/#:~:text=There%20have%20now%20been%20three,over%20the%20past%2015%20years.) 2020 . 1% of the CI have been installed worldwide. 
How could there be such a discrepancy between the obsession with vision and the visual technology? 

What do you think? Any idea? (questionnaire)
Well,as always in science/and just like I said to my ex-wife ... (Gif) It's not what you think. 

So there's two way of explaining this: The boring way and the cool way. With the boring way we'll go through each steps of the creation of retinal prosthetics from ground up. With the cool way we'll look at every layer of the eye, and see how we could create our own retinal prosthetic on our own! 
So, what do you choose? Boring? Cool?

As a scientist, the seeker of truth, its my duty to choose... both. 

# How do vision work
Before understanding how Retinal prothesis can recreate vision, let's look at how vision works. What are the important parts of it, and how can we screw them to justify the 200K euros of our RP. 
Vision starts by the cornea, goes through the lense and then hit the retina layer, where there's the photo receptors, Cones and rods. Then, those transduce the photons/lights into signal, that move to the bipolar cell, in the next layer, who then moves it to the RGCs, our target region. 
- Questions: What happen to the membrane of the PhotoR? Gets hyperpolarized, which removes Glutamate, making the pigment (iodopsin or rhodopsin,) change conformation, which reduces the cGMP concentration, a well knowed 2nd messenge,  --> no entering of Na then hyperpolarization, that stop the release of Glu NT, and this will actually  excited the bipolar cells
- Why do we stim the RCCs and not the Photoreceptor? ()
The RGCs then move the signal to the Optic nerve, Moves to the Optic tract, reaches the Lateral Geniticulated Nucleus, That projects to the Occipital cortex, 1°Visual Cortex. 

So. Now, let's see, where we can fuck this up?[ Any ideas?](https://www.brightfocus.org/macular/article/eye-diseases-can-cause-legal-blindness)
- Cataract lenses.
- Strokes
- Glaucoma -retinal die.
- age-related macular degeneration
-   retinitis pigmentosa
-   diabetic retinopathy
Match them to the parts of the brain.

AMD: Destroy of the macula the specialized central part of the retina
Retinitis Pigmentosa: Rare genetic diseases

So, these two last are particularly interesting because they directly screw the retinal cells, and stimulation from other regions can't help. 
(How is it simlar to chochlea? Loosing hearing will also deteriorate your inner cells, that transduct and convey sounds )

### Why did we choose Retinal Mostly?
That's where RP comes into play, because they will stimulate directly the RP. Not the part where there's signal transduction (the photoreceptors), but really just before the optic nerve
- advantage obvious: 125 M PRCs for 1.5 RGCs.
- different from Cochlear Implant. 
Retinal prosthesis will try to stimulate the remaining retinal ganglion, just like CI, and restore, "some kind" of vision to the subjects (INSERT STORY OF PHOSPHENES) and those phosphenes can significantly restore the vision of patient. 

Ok. Let's wrap it up. Most of the diseases out there involve more or less the retina, so it'd make sense to stimulate it. Right? Wrong. 
Because every part that's beyond the Retina, is also stimulatable. Actually, since a part of the RGCs get destroyed due to the diseases, it'd make sense to stimulate EVERYTING beyond the retina. So why is most of the research focusing on the retina? Good question. Let's talk about it: 

Let's go from the retina, step by step, to test every possibilty. After the retina we have the optic nerve. 
OPTIC NERVE: Study show that by variating the pulse duration, frequency applied to the ON, we can elicit phosphenes at different localtions. Since we directly stimulate the nerve, we don't need that much current so double win! 
But wait. There's some obvious drawback: Very small nerve[  1-μm diameter optic nerve fibers](([Jonas et al., 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B74))
Then let's go to the next stop: 
The Lateral Geniculate Nucleaus (LGN): It's situated after the optic chiasm, and  would be coon for patient that have an issue with their nerve. But the drawback is -> Surgical intense
CORTEX: 
Good: When injuries in LGN OPTic nerve, Retina. Because the Cortical Map of the Cortex is well known, it'd be easier to stimulate the right regions to have the same image, 
Bad:  Almost everything else: Need too much electrode, transmitting the signal, also there are convolutions in the brain, hard to touch by the electrode. This is Elon Musk- Neural Link 

How can we go further. As a species. What are other crazier way to do that?

- Optogenetics: Add viral vectors, encode Opsins in tissues like Retina. Apply light with an LED matrice and stimulate the retina
Problem: Ethics
- Magentic Stimulation: Using it to stimulate neurons at a specific region. Non invasive, some [studies](([Bonmassar et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00036/full#B14)) Show its possible in vitro 
Problem: Advance in material science -> Biocompatible polymers (induction), Coils usualy not power efficient, lack of heat dissipation
NEXT: SPiderman
- Nanoparticule based Stimulation: Currently used to deliver drugs, Combination with Magnetic gradient  -> Guiding the NanooP to act on membrane channel ex: V1 neurons. 
Problem:  How to deliver in the CNS (blod brain), LT effects, 
- Sensory Substitution: Synesthesia
Take grid of phosphenses, put in on tactil or auditory;  
Tactile -> Limiting reading capabilities
Help with strokes, destroy of brain cells.

Great ! Awesome. So as we can see, even if there are more reliable places to stimulate the brain, the technology is simply not following yet. This is why currently the RP are the most used prothesis. 

So, we decided to stimulate the retina directly which is smart becaus qe are not risking our patients life. - surgery safer in retinal - Now let's try to see what challenges we need to overcome to do so. 

As I explain before, the retinal layer is made of many sub-layer. The outer layer, where light from the lense hit, is the photoreceptor-layer. Then light is transducted to the bipolar, then RGCs. As I said, there's a lot of signal processing happening there: 
1. Most of the photoreceptors are contained in the central part, but less in the periphery
2. Many PR are smaller and more compact in the middle part rather than the periphery,
3. - So, at the macular (middle) 1:1:1 ratio, but a looot more when we get away. 
4. and 1000 of PR combine to stimulase the RCGs
5. The RGCs are further subdived into ON and OFF cells, that depending on the light stimuli in the eyes, can actually be activated or deactivated
6. Further, a lot of modulation also arise from amacrine and other cells
In the end, the signal that reaches the RP has little to do with the original light signal in intensity or color. 
7. Retinotrophy changes

One of the way of stimulating that is to stimulate direclty from the cells in the subretinal here(point) like the bipolar cells, before there's this signal processing. But because they are deeper in the eyes, they could damage the retina, and also don't dissipate heat enough.ds


So how do we solve the problem of having so much RCGs? Think about solultions #retinalcochlea 
Because by stimulating just some parts of the RP, we can obtain a roughly good enough image, to restore some kind of vision. Because of all oof the problems cited here, the resulting vision will really be poor. But may be, usuable. 

So then, how do we stimulate those RCGs? First of all, we have some limitation. The electrode grid we have are very big, () and therefore, can stimulate them enough. If we try to reduce the electrodes, then it will increase the charge density, making the current higher. 

After a lot of research, scientist find that with a low number of electrodes relatively spaced out, it's positive to have enough accuity to regain vison. 
For  example the Argus II uses a 6* 10  electrodes grid, and is capable of * generating phosphenes to distinguish vision. The elveetrodes are spaced 575um appart

Ok we have the electrodes grids. 
- Spacial
- Intensity
- Frequency

## But how did we figured out, stimulating the RGCs will result into vision (Later)
