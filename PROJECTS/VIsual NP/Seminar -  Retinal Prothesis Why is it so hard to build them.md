The central question to elucidate is: What keeps Retinal Prosthetics from working

1. Why aren't they as good as chochlear implant. 
2. What makes it challenging to build them
3. What are the different approaches that exist to build them

What problem do retinal implants solve? (show the eye, and show the pieces where they can be destroyed)
1. AMD
2. RP
- Those diseases don't apply to a very big percentage of the population so don't really help a lot of people
- Only 200 patients for the Argus for example
- But people have been 
- Talk about how vision works: Receptive Field activation, need excitatory and inhibitory signals. 
Vision is the most important of our senses. People say it may take up to 80% of our perception and indeed, most of the studies on sensory modality have been done of vision. 
Look at the auditory diagram. If there's [700K cochlear implants ](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants#:~:text=Children%20and%20adults%20who%20are,adults%20and%2065%2C000%20in%20children.)wordlwide, just imagine how much retinal implants exists: Do a fake diagram comparing CI andRI: 50000 RI. Only 50K implants... sorry. Wait what? That can be so low... Oh. Sorry . I actually mixed the slides. Here's the real number... [500 patients in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198351/#:~:text=There%20have%20now%20been%20three,over%20the%20past%2015%20years.) 2020 . 1% of the CI have been installed worldwide. 
How could there be such a discrepancy between the obsession with vision and the visual technology? 

What do you think? Any idea? (questionnaire)
Well,as always in science/and just like I said to my ex-wife ... (Gif) It's not what you think. 

So there's two way of explaining this: The boring way and the cool way. With the boring way we'll go through each steps of the creation of retinal prosthetics from ground up. With the cool way we'll look at every layer of the eye, and see how we could create our own retinal prosthetic on our own! 
So, what do you choose? Boring? Cool?

As a scientist, the seeker of truth, its my duty to choose... both. 

# How do vision work
Before understanding how Retinal prothesis can recreate vision, let's look at how vision works. What are the important parts of it, and how can we screw them to justify the 200K euros of our RP. 
Vision starts by the cornea, goes through the lense and then hit the retina layer, where there's the photo receptors, Cones and rods. Then, those transduce the photons/lights into signal, that move to the bipolar cell, in the next layer, who then moves it to the RGCs, our target region. 
- Questions: What happen to the membrane of the PhotoR? Gets hyperpolarized, which removes Glutamate, making the pigment (iodopsin or rhodopsin,) change conformation, which reduces the cGMP concentration, a well knowed 2nd messenge,  --> no entering of Na then hyperpolarization, that stop the release of Glu NT, and this will actually  excited the bipolar cells
- Why do we stim the RCCs and not the Photoreceptor? ()
The RGCs then move the signal to the Optic nerve,
