- Create a template for writing copy for the Confiotes and especially titles. 
Look for multiple copies like that, not jsut because it's a good trianing but because there's no way you can get better if you don't train by that as much as possible. You and the team. Look for every good headlines for liquor and stuffs just lije us. Look for things that confirm the structure of the book copycriting

	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

How can you enhance the 1st impression of your copy?
- front cover for the catalogue
- First 20s of a video (even first 6)
- Headline+visual


The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which decides whether the  
reader will read the copy.  
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your  
headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.  
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s money.  
Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I  
have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?  
Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good  
headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do  
you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?

## how do deliver as much message with headlines
Your headline can perform four different tasks:  
1. Get attention.  
2. Select the audience.  
3. Deliver a complete message.  
4. Draw the reader into the body copy.  

Let’s take a look at how headlines perform each of these jobs.  
## 1. Getting Attention  

“Give Your Kids a Fighting Chance” Crest  
“Why Swelter Through Another Hot Summer?” GE air conditioners  
“For Deep-Clean, Oil-Free Skin, Noxzema Has the Solution” Noxzema moisturizer  

**Give novelty:**
Another effective attention-getting gambit is to give the reader news. Headlines that give news often use words such as new, discover, introducing, announcing, now, it’s here, at last, and just arrived.  “New Sensational Video Can Give You Thin Thighs Starting  Now!” Exercise  “Discover Our New Rich-Roasted Taste” Decaffeinated  
coffee.

**Give Free gift**
If you can legitimately use the word free in your headline, do so. Free is one of the most powerful words in  the copywriter’s vocabulary. Everybody wants to get something for free.  
Other powerful attention-getting words include how to, why, you, sale, quick, easy, bargain, last chance, guarantee, results, proven, and save. D**o not avoid these words because other copywriters use them with such frequency.** Other copywriters use these words because they work. You should, too. Grade your performance as  
a copywriter on sales generated by your copy, not on originality.  

**Useful actionnable information**
Headlines that offer the reader useful information are also attention getters. The information promised in the headline can be given in the copy or in a free booklet the reader can send for. 
*Some examples:*
	“Free New Report on 67 Emerging Growth  
	Stocks” Merrill Lynch  
	“Three Easy Steps to Fine Wood Finishing” Minwax Wood Finish  
	“How to Bake Beans” Van Camp’s  

Many advertisers try to get attention with headlines and gimmicks that **don’t promise the reader a benefit or  are not related to the product in any way.**

When you write a headline, get attention by picking out an important customer benefit or concern and  presenting it in a clear, bold, dramatic fashion. Avoid headlines and concepts that are cute, clever, and  titillating but irrelevant. They may generate some hoopla, but they do not sell.  

## 2. Selecting the Audience  
In the same way, an ad for a $95,000 sports car should imply, “This is for rich  folks only!” You don’t want to waste time answering inquiries from people who cannot afford the product.  
The headline can select the right audience for your ad and screen out those readers who are not potential customers. A good headline for a life insurance ad might read, “To Men and Women over 65 Who Need Affordable Life Insurance Coverage.”  

“A Message to All Charter Security Life Policyholders of Single Premium Deferred  
Annuities”  
“Is Your Electric Bill Too High?” Utility ad  
“Can you trust solar heating companies you never heard of who try to sell you solar roof  
panels over the phone?” Solar panels  

## 3. Delivering a Complete Message  
Sell a complete message because those n-words won't even read through.
Here are a few headlines that deliver complete messages:  
“Caught Soon Enough, Early Tooth Decay Can Actually Be Repaired by Colgate!”  
“Hitachi Chiller-Heater Cuts Cooling and Heating Costs Up to 50%”  
“Allstate—with accident insurance, they guarantee your car insurance rates won’t go up because of an accident.”  
Ogilvy recommends that you include the selling promise and the brand name in the headline. Many effective  
headlines don’t include the product name. But put it in if you suspect most of your prospects won’t bother to read the copy underneath. For instance, having the product name in the headline or subhead in a half-page  newspaper ad for health offers typically boosts response.  

## 4. Drawing the Reader into the Body Copy  
**Certain product categories—liquor, soft drinks, and fashion, for example—can be sold with an attractive photo,  a powerful headline, and a minimum of words.** 
LES CONFIOTES

But many products—automobiles, computers, books, records, home study programs, life insurance, and  
investments—require that the reader be given a lot of information. That information appears in the body copy,  
and for the ad to be effective the headline must compel the reader to read this copy.  
To draw the reader into the body copy, you must arouse his or her curiosity. You can do this with news, or  
intrigue, or mystery. You can ask a question or make a provocative statement. You can promise a reward,  
news, or useful information.  
A sales letter offering motivational pamphlets was mailed to business managers. The headline of the letter  
was “What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?” Naturally, American  
managers wanted to find out about the techniques the Japanese use to run their businesses so effectively.  
A classic headline for an ad offering a facial lotion reads: “The $5 Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.” The  
reader is lured into the ad to satisfy her curiosity about what this inexpensive alternative might be. The  
headline would not have been as successful if it said, “$5 Bottle of Lotion Is an Inexpensive Alternative to  
Costly Plastic Surgery.”
