How should the copies of Les Confiotes be?
	1. Attention grabbin headlings
	2. looks more like an editorial than an ad (does it make it more likely to be read?)
	3. makes a specific offer
- Find a vocabulary to describe liquors
	- Look more on google
	- Look at your top competitors
	- Who are the liquors and syrups and juice top competitors
- Look for brands with good marketing on liquor and juices


- Create a template for writing copy for the Confiotes and especially titles. 
Look for multiple copies like that, not jsut because it's a good trianing but because there's no way you can get better if you don't train by that as much as possible. You and the team. Look for every good headlines for liquor and stuffs just lije us. Look for things that confirm the structure of the book copycriting
(Reading the Handbook for copywriting)
	Look for ads of your top competitor, and how to implement them

- 3 keys to write good 
	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

How can you enhance the 1st impression of your copy?
- front cover for the catalogue
- First 20s of a video (even first 6)
- Headline+visual


The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which decides whether the  
reader will read the copy.  
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your  
headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.  
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s money.  
Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I  
have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?  
Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good  
headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do  
you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?

## how do deliver as much message with headlines
Your headline can perform four different tasks:  
1. Get attention.  
2. Select the audience.  
3. Deliver a complete message.  
4. Draw the reader into the body copy.  

Let’s take a look at how headlines perform each of these jobs.  
## 1. Getting Attention  

“Give Your Kids a Fighting Chance” Crest  
“Why Swelter Through Another Hot Summer?” GE air conditioners  
“For Deep-Clean, Oil-Free Skin, Noxzema Has the Solution” Noxzema moisturizer  

**Give novelty:**
Another effective attention-getting gambit is to give the reader news. Headlines that give news often use words such as new, discover, introducing, announcing, now, it’s here, at last, and just arrived.  “New Sensational Video Can Give You Thin Thighs Starting  Now!” Exercise  “Discover Our New Rich-Roasted Taste” Decaffeinated  
coffee.
=>Confiotes: Découvrer nos 3 nouveaux produits que les bartender s'arrachent!

**Give Free gift**
If you can legitimately use the word free in your headline, do so. Free is one of the most powerful words in  the copywriter’s vocabulary. Everybody wants to get something for free.  
Other powerful attention-getting words include how to, why, you, sale, quick, easy, bargain, last chance, guarantee, results, proven, and save. D**o not avoid these words because other copywriters use them with such frequency.** Other copywriters use these words because they work. You should, too. Grade your performance as  
a copywriter on sales generated by your copy, not on originality.  

**Useful actionnable information**
Headlines that offer the reader useful information are also attention getters. The information promised in the headline can be given in the copy or in a free booklet the reader can send for. 
*Some examples:*
	“Free New Report on 67 Emerging Growth  
	Stocks” Merrill Lynch  
	“Three Easy Steps to Fine Wood Finishing” Minwax Wood Finish  
	“How to Bake Beans” Van Camp’s  

Many advertisers try to get attention with headlines and gimmicks that **don’t promise the reader a benefit or  are not related to the product in any way.**

When you write a headline, get attention by picking out an important customer benefit or concern and  presenting it in a clear, bold, dramatic fashion. Avoid headlines and concepts that are cute, clever, and  titillating but irrelevant. They may generate some hoopla, but they do not sell.  

## 2. Selecting the Audience  
In the same way, an ad for a $95,000 sports car should imply, “This is for rich  folks only!” You don’t want to waste time answering inquiries from people who cannot afford the product.  
The headline can select the right audience for your ad and screen out those readers who are not potential customers. A good headline for a life insurance ad might read, “To Men and Women over 65 Who Need Affordable Life Insurance Coverage.”  

“A Message to All Charter Security Life Policyholders of Single Premium Deferred  
Annuities”  
“Is Your Electric Bill Too High?” Utility ad  
“Can you trust solar heating companies you never heard of who try to sell you solar roof  
panels over the phone?” Solar panels  

## 3. Delivering a Complete Message  
Sell a complete message because those n-words won't even read through.
Here are a few headlines that deliver complete messages:  
“Caught Soon Enough, Early Tooth Decay Can Actually Be Repaired by Colgate!”  
“Hitachi Chiller-Heater Cuts Cooling and Heating Costs Up to 50%”  
“Allstate—with accident insurance, they guarantee your car insurance rates won’t go up because of an accident.”  
Ogilvy recommends that you include the selling promise and the brand name in the headline. Many effective  
headlines don’t include the product name. But put it in if you suspect most of your prospects won’t bother to read the copy underneath. For instance, having the product name in the headline or subhead in a half-page  newspaper ad for health offers typically boosts response.  

## 4. Drawing the Reader into the Body Copy  
**Certain product categories—liquor, soft drinks, and fashion, for example—can be sold with an attractive photo,  a powerful headline, and a minimum of words.** 
LES CONFIOTES

 
To draw the reader into the body copy, you must arouse his or her curiosity. You can do this with news, or  intrigue, or mystery. You can ask a question or make a provocative statement. You can promise a reward, news, or useful information.  

 “What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?” Naturally, American  managers wanted to find out about the techniques the Japanese use to run their businesses so effectively.  
 
  **a facial lotion reads**: “The $5 Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.” The reader is lured into the ad to satisfy her curiosity about what this inexpensive alternative might be. The  
headline would not have been as successful if it said, “$5 Bottle of Lotion Is an Inexpensive Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.”  

## Headlines examples
1. Ask a question in the headline.  
“What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?”  
2. Tie-in to current events.

3. Create a new terminology.  
“New ‘Polarized Oil’ Magnetically Adheres to Wear Parts in Machine Tools, Making Them Last Up to 6  
Times Longer.”  
4. Give news using the words “new,” “introduction,” or “announcing.”  
“Announcing a Painless Cut in Defense Spending.”  
5. Give the reader a command—tell him to do something.  
“Try Burning This Coupon.”

“Who Ever Heard of 17,000 Blooms from a Single Plant?”
7. Promise the reader useful information.  
“How to Avoid the Biggest Mistake You Can Make in Building or Buying a Home.”

“The One Internet Stock You MUST Own Now. Hint: It’s NOT What You Think!”  
18. Promise to reveal a secret.

21. Add a time element.  
“Instant Incorporation While U-Wait.”  
22. Stress cost savings, discounts, or value.  
“Now You Can Get $2,177 Worth of Expensive Stock Market Newsletters for the Incredibly Low Price of  
Just $69!”  
23. Give the reader good news.  
“You’re Never Too Old to Hear Better.”  
24. Offer an alternative to other products and services.  
“No Time for Yale—Took College at Home Online.”  
25. Issue a challenge.  
“Will Your Scalp Stand the Fingernail Test?”  
26. Stress your guarantee.  
“Develop Software Applications Up to 6 Times Faster or Your Money Back.”

38. Make a seemingly contradictory statement or promise.  
“Cool Any Room in Your House Fast—Without Air Conditioning!”  
Notice that many of these headline use numbers. Numbers attract the reader’s eye. They should always be  
written as numerals. If you say “7 reasons why,” prospects want to know the seven reasons and will read the  
ad to learn them. Also ads and content written as lists, or “listicles,” which look more like editorial content, are
You can use the How to
##  the 4U's formula

 
- Urgent: Make $100,000 working from home this year”  
has a greater sense of urgency than “Make $100,000 working from home.” Once  
the offer period is over, the offer is no longer available.
- Unique:   
The powerful headline either says something new or, if it says something the reader has heard  before, says it in a new and fresh way. For example, “Why Japanese women have beautiful skin” was the headline in an e-mail promoting a Japanese bath kit. This is different from the typical “Save 10% on Japanese  
Bath Kits.”
- Ultra-specific: Examples: “What never to eat on an airplane,” “Bills it’s okay to pay late, and “Best time to file for a tax refund.”
- Useful: The strong subject line appeals to the reader’s self-interest by offering a benefit. In the headline “An Invitation to Ski & Save,” the benefit is saving money.

=> Check how much does your headline does in all of those parts on a scale to 1 to 4. You gotta reach at least 9/16, with 3 or more on all of them. If they are, then the headline is clickbait. 

## Example of a title that sucks balls
A marketer wrote to tell me he had sent out a successful e-mail marketing campaign with **the subject line  “Free Special Report.**” How does this stack up against the 4 U’s? 

• Urgent. There is no urgency or sense of timeliness. On a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the highest rating,  “Free Special Report” is a 1.  
• Unique. Not every marketer offers a free special report, but a lot of them do. So “Free Special Report”  rates only a 2 in terms of uniqueness.  
• Ultra-specific. Could the marketer have been less specific than “Free Special Report”? Yes, he could have just said “Free Bonus Gift.” So we rate “Free Special Report” a 2 instead of a • Useful. I suppose the reader is smart enough to figure that the report contains some helpful information.  On the other hand, the usefulness is in the specific information contained in the report, which isn’t even hinted  at in the headline. And does the recipient, who already has too much to read, really need yet another “free  
special report”? I rate it a 2. Specifying the topic would help (e.g., “Free special report reveals how to cut  training costs up to 90% with e-learning”).




## Struggle producing a Headline? Follow those steps:
1. Who is my customer?  
2. What are the important features of the product?  
3. Which of these features do competing products lack?   **(USP)**
4. Why will the customer want to buy the product? (What product feature delivers the benefit most  important to him?)

Ok. I answer tat shit. Then what? Well, fucker, then you: 
1. write 6 to 8 headlines
 Nothing good?

1. Use you always. Exemple To cancel an order, return the merchandise to us in its  
original container. When we have received the book in salable condition, we will inform our Accounting Department that the invoice is canceled.

If you’re not satisfied with the book, simply return it to us  
and tear up your invoice. You won’t owe us a cent. What could be fairer than that?  

2. ORGANISE YOUR SELLING POINTS
Pincus, a freelance copywriter, developed a unique organizational pattern for the sales letters he writes. Pincus begins with a headline that conveys a promise, shows how the promise is fulfilled, and gives proof that the product is everything the copy says it is. Then he tells the reader how to order the product and  
explains why the cost of the product is insignificant compared to its value.  
Before you create an ad or landing page, write down your sales points. Organize them in a logical, persuasive, clear fashion. And present them in this order when you write your copy.

Here are 4 simple writing principles that can do more than any other writing techniques to make your copy clear  
and easy to read:  
Short words.  
Short sentences.  
Short paragraphs.  
Short sections.  

# Model Headlines for references
38 MODEL HEADLINES FOR YOUR “SWIPE FILE”  
A “swipe file” is a collection of promotions that you turn to for reference when creating your own marketing  
materials. The best way to get ideas for headlines when you are stuck is to keep a swipe file and consult it for  
inspiration when you sit down to write a new ad or mailing.  
The best swipe samples are those that keep running. You know they are being repeated—because they are  
profitable. Put a red X on any swipe samples you see multiple times, so you can identify winners at a glance.

# CONTENT MARKETING
## what makes  a great content
I wrote a post about social media audits and published it on my blog. It received no comments or  social activity AT ALL. I later submitted the exact same piece to the Social Media Today website. It  was tweeted hundreds of times and I also had some great responses across the blogosphere.  
So much for great content. It’s the exact same article, but since my blog doesn’t have authority or  community, it wouldn't have been found or read regardless of the quality of my work.  I think at this point the focus has to move from content creation toward the idea of building  community, developing strategies to distribute the content, and marketing to promote every piece.”  
Marcela hit on some more suspicions that point to the elusive Content Code: Regardless of quality, content  marketing success must also include community, distribution, and promotion.  

**The Mirabeau miracle**  
Consider one more example that points to the secrets to content marketing success in an information dense world.  
A few years ago, I was approached by a friendly fellow named Stephen Cronk for help on a new marketing  
strategy. Here’s a summary of his story:  
He left his corporate job in London and moved his family to the Provence region of France.  
In the teeth of a recession and with no previous wine-making experience, he started a new winery called  
Mirabeau.  
He had 600 established competitors—and that was just in Provence!  
This was a tough assignment, but I do love a challenge, and most important, I believed in Stephen. He  
possessed an excellent business mind, an urgency to learn, and a great sense of storytelling. I had to say  
yes!  
Our first step was to determine where he could maneuver in a highly saturated, low-growth market. We  
couldn’t afford to be a “me too.” We conducted a complete market and competitive analysis and discovered  
that among the hundreds of wineries in his region, none of them had a meaningful digital marketing  
presence. At the same time, his potential retail customers were trying to gain a foothold in the social media  
space. In this intersection, we found our opportunity.  
We had to scale a content marketing effort quickly and decided that Stephen’s primary source would be  
video. He was a natural on camera, and the lush and ancient countryside of Provence provided an ideal  
backdrop to explore wine making, food, history, art, and the local color.  
Stephen consistently documented his wine-making journey in a very human and entertaining way. He  
talked about a labeling crisis that almost crushed his business. He created entertaining videos about the  
ridiculous paperwork he faced from the French government, what it was like to attend an international wine-  
tasting competition, and how the grapes were harvested in the early morning sunlight. He created stories  
about his village, his pets, and his family. He shared his anguish as he knelt beside grape vines decimated by  
a 13-minute hail storm. He captured the pure joy of his children dancing while on a family vacation.  
He was putting a human and modern face to a stodgy, traditional business.  
In addition to producing content, we also had a network strategy and continuously worked on building a  
wine-loving audience that was passionate about his product and the stories from his little family business. As  
his audience and engagement multiplied, Stephen was able to share this data with huge wine retailers to  
prove a point of differentiation. No winemaker in the region had the presence and audience that the upstart  
Mirabeau had. The strategy worked, and the orders started coming in.  
Stephen followed our strategy to dominate this unsaturated content niche and his progress was steady.  
But on his 222nd video, Stephen found the gold at the end of the rainbow. In just 29 seconds, he  
demonstrated how to open a wine bottle with only his shoe.6 That video has now attracted well over 9 million  
views ... one of the greatest small business video success stories in the history of the web!  
The viral attention gave a significant lift to all the content on the site. Because Stephen had worked so  
long and hard to provide entertaining videos, the viral visitors stuck around to see what else he had for them.  
Since the “shoe video,” the winery’s “About Mirabeau” video on its YouTube channel has received more than  
10,000 new views. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and newsletter subscriptions have had massive  
gains.  
The tiny winery received immense media attention from both the mainstream press and wine industry  
bloggers who marveled at Stephen’s authentic and human storytelling:
