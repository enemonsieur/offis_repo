	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

- Headline+visual


The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which decides whether the  
reader will read the copy.  
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your  
headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.  
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s money.  
Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I  
have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?  
Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good  
headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do  
you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?

## how do deliver as much message with headlines
Your headline can perform four different tasks:  
1. Get attention.  
2. Select the audience.  
3. Deliver a complete message.  
4. Draw the reader into the body copy.  

Let’s take a look at how headlines perform each of these jobs.  
## 1. Getting Attention  

“Give Your Kids a Fighting Chance” Crest  
“Why Swelter Through Another Hot Summer?” GE air conditioners  
“For Deep-Clean, Oil-Free Skin, Noxzema Has the Solution” Noxzema moisturizer  

**Give novelty:**
Another effective attention-getting gambit is to give the reader news. Headlines that give news often use words such as new, discover, introducing, announcing, now, it’s here, at last, and just arrived.  “New Sensational Video Can Give You Thin Thighs Starting  Now!” Exercise  “Discover Our New Rich-Roasted Taste” Decaffeinated  
coffee.

**Give Free gift**
If you can legitimately use the word free in your headline, do so. Free is one of the most powerful words in  the copywriter’s vocabulary. Everybody wants to get something for free.  
Other powerful attention-getting words include how to, why, you, sale, quick, easy, bargain, last chance, guarantee, results, proven, and save. D**o not avoid these words because other copywriters use them with such frequency.** Other copywriters use these words because they work. You should, too. Grade your performance as  
a copywriter on sales generated by your copy, not on originality.  

**Useful actionnable information**
Headlines that offer the reader useful information are also attention getters. The information promised in the headline can be given in the copy or in a free booklet the reader can send for.
