Look for multiple copies like that, not jsut because it's a good trianing but because there's no way you can get better if you don't train by that as much as possible. You and the team. Look for every good headlines for liquor and stuffs just lije us. Look for things that confirm the structure of the book copycriting

	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

How can you enhance the 1st impression of your copy?

The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which decides whether the  
reader will read the copy.  
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your  
headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.  
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s money.  
Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I  
have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?  
Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good  
headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do  
you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?
