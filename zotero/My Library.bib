  abstract = {Suffering from continuous stress can lead to serious psychological and even physical disorders. Objective stress assessment methods using noninvasive physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalograms (EEG) have therefore been proposed for effective stress management. In this study, a novel wearable device that can measure electrocardiograms (ECG) and EEG simultaneously was designed to enable continuous stress monitoring in daily life. The developed system is easily worn by hanging from both ears, is lightweight (i.e., 42.5 g), and exhibits an excellent noise performance of 0.12 μVrms. Significant time and frequency features of HRV and EEG were found in two different stressors, namely the Stroop color word and mental arithmetic tests, using 14 young subjects. Stressor situations were classified using various HRV and EEG feature selections and a support vector machine technique. The five-fold cross-validation results obtained when using both EEG and HRV features showed the best performance with an accuracy of 87.5\%, which demonstrated the requirement for simultaneous HRV and EEG measurements.},

  abstract = {Traffic safety is directly related to the mental and physical condition of the driver. Performing regular secondary tasks while driving is an additional activity that dissipates attention and adds to the drivers’ workload. Identi­ fying driver fatigue and workload based on gaze behavior is one way to ensure a safe driving experience. The purpose of this paper is to classify and predict driving perceived workload using a set of eye-tracking metrics (gaze fixation, duration, pointing, and pupil diameter). The ability of eye-tracking metrics to predict driving workload has been investigated. As a result, frustration, performance, and temporal load showed a correlation with gaze metrics. Gaze point, duration, fixation, and pupil diameter significantly influence driving workload. Relevance to industry: Results will supply the specialists in eye-tracking/sensor technologies and traffic safety with new knowledge to improve the design of the driving performance and safety monitoring systems and ef­ ficiency of the driving process.},

  abstract = {Objective: Healthcare institutions worldwide are moving to electronic health records (EHRs). These transitions are particularly numerous in the US where healthcare systems are purchasing and implementing commercial EHRs to fulfill federal requirements. Despite the central role of EHRs to workflow, the cognitive impact of these transitions on the workforce has not been widely studied. This study assesses the changes in cognitive workload among pediatric nurses during data entry and retrieval tasks during transition from a hybrid electronic and paper information system to a commercial EHR. Materials and methods: Baseline demographics and computer attitude and skills scores were obtained from 74 pediatric nurses in two wards. They also completed an established and validated instrument, the NASA-TLX, that is designed to measure cognitive workload; this instrument was used to evaluate cognitive workload of data entry and retrieval. The NASATLX was administered at baseline (pre-implementation), 1, 5 and 10 shifts and 4 months post-implementation of the new EHR. Results: Most nurse participants experienced significant increases of cognitive workload at 1 and 5 shifts after “go-live”. These increases abated at differing rates predicted by participants’ computer attitudes scores (p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is substantially increased cognitive workload for nurses during the early phases (1–5 shifts) of EHR transitions. Health systems should anticipate variability across workers adapting to “meaningful use” EHRs. “One-size-fits-all” training strategies may not be suitable and longer periods of technical support may be necessary for some workers.},

  abstract = {This review investigates the effects of psychological stress on the human body measured through biosignals. When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on biosignal patterns caused during stress conditions and reliable practical guidelines towards more efficient detection of stress.},

  abstract = {High workload of nurses in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has been identified as a major patient safety and worker stress problem. However, relatively little attention has been dedicated to the measurement of workload in healthcare. The objectives of this study are to describe and examine several methods to measure workload of ICU nurses. We then focus on the measurement of ICU nurses’ workload using a subjective rating instrument: the NASA TLX. We conducted secondary data analysis on data from two, multi-site, cross-sectional questionnaire studies to examine several instruments to measure ICU nurses’ workload. The combined database contains the data from 757 ICU nurses in eight hospitals and 21 ICUs. Results show that the different methods to measure workload of ICU nurses, such as patient-based and operator-based workload, are only moderately correlated, or not correlated at all. Results show further that among the operator-based instruments, the NASA TLX is the most reliable and valid questionnaire to measure workload and that NASA TLX can be used in a healthcare setting. Managers of hospitals and ICUs can benefit from the results of this research as it provides benchmark data on workload experienced by nurses in a variety of ICUs.},

  abstract = {Stress is a physiological and psychological pressure perceived by an individual that placing himself/herself in a risk, both physically and mentally. The research objective of this research is to find out whether the level of technology competence and workload has an impact on employee performance through technostress as an intervening variable. The respondents of this study were 138 people whom work at Production and Engineering department of a multinational company using automation technology equipment in operation. A technique of data collection was done by using questionaire and interviews. Data was analysed using the SEM (Structural Equation Modelling) approach. From the research it can be concluded that the workload and competence level of automation technology had significant impact to technostress. Further, the study also shows a significant relationships between workload and employee performance which the Technostress acts as an intervening variable in the relationship.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces a method for resolving the problem of human stress detection through short-term (less than 5 min) electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) signals. The explored methodology helps to improve the stress detection rate and reliability through multiple evidences originated in same sensor. In this work, stress-inducing protocol, data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification are the major steps involved to detect the stress. In total, 60 subjects (30 males and 30 females) participated in the Stroop color word-based stress-inducing task and ECG signal was acquired simultaneously. The wavelet denoising algorithm was applied to remove high frequency, baseline wander and power line noises. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based heart rate (HR) detection algorithm is used for deriving HRV signal from the preprocessed ECG signal. The ectopic beat removal method is employed to eliminate the ectopic beat and noise peaks in the HRV signal. In order to detect the stress, the issue of uneven sampling with the HRV signal has been successfully rectified using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP). The application of LSP in short-term HRV signals (32 s), uneven sampling issue, and power spectral information issue has been rectified and the trustworthiness of the short-term HRV signal has been proved by hypothesis as well as experimental results. Theoretical analysis suggested that a minimum 25 s of online or offline ECG data is required to analyze the autonomous nervous system (ANS) activity related to stress. In addition to the HRV signal, ECG-based stress assessment has been proposed to detect the stress through optimum features using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Various features extracted from the ECG and HRV signal have been classified into normal and stress using PNN and kNN classifiers with different smoothing factor and k values. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology for short-term ECG and HRV signal can achieve the overall average classification accuracy of 91.66\% and 94.66\% in the subject-independent mode.},

Methods: Systematic literature searches of computerized databases were performed to identify articles on psychometric evaluation of the PSS. Results: The search finally identified 19 articles. Internal consistency reliability, factorial validity, and hypothesis validity of the PSS were well reported. However, the test-retest reliability and criterion validity were relatively rarely evaluated. In general, the psychometric properties of the 10-item PSS were found to be superior to those of the 14-item PSS, while those of the 4-item scale fared the worst. The psychometric properties of the PSS have been evaluated empirically mostly using populations of college students or workers. Conclusion: Overall, the PSS is an easy-to-use questionnaire with established acceptable psychometric properties. However, future studies should evaluate these psychometric properties in greater depth, and validate the scale using diverse populations.},

This article reviews research based on a multidimensional assessment of state dimensions in the performance context, the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ). Various types of evidence for validity support differentiating task engagement, distress, and worry dimensions as indices of the dynamic transaction between the performer and the task environment. The article aims to illustrate different uses of the scale in theory-based and applied studies of individual differences in performance. One usage is investigating relationships between personality traits, resilience, and stress reactivity. Subjective states reflect cognitive stress processes (appraisal and coping), which may be biased by traits. A second usage is testing theories of stress effects on attention and performance; research findings link task engagement to resources for sustained and focused attention, and distress to impairments in working memory and executive control. A third usage is testing states as mediators of personality-performance associations. Individual differences in human performance may reflect biological, cognitive, and self-regulative processes, so that interpretation of subjective state scores requires an explicit theoretical orientation. Practical applications of the multidimensional model include support for stress mitigation, training, personnel selection and team performance.},

We further look at the role of technology self-efficacy, organizational mechanisms that inhibit technostress and technology competence as possible mitigations to the effects of technostress creators. Our findings show a negative association between technostress creators and performance. We find that, while traditional effort-based mechanisms such as building technology competence reduce the impact of technostress creators on technology-enabled innovation and performance, more empowering mechanisms such as developing technology self-efficacy and information systems (IS) literacy enhancement and involvement in IS initiatives are required to counter the decrease in overall performance because of technostress creators. Noting that the professional sales context offers increasingly high expectations for technology-enabled performance in an inherently interpersonal-oriented and relationship-oriented environment with regard to overall performance, and high failure rates for IS acceptance/use, the study uses survey data collected from 237 institutional sales professionals.}

  abstract = {Recent studies have addressed stress level classification via electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning. These works typically use EEG-based features, like power spectral density (PSD), to develop stress classifiers. Nonetheless, these classifiers are usually limited to the discrimination of two (stress and no stress) or three (low, medium, and high) stress levels. In this study we propose an alternative for quantitative stress assessment based on EEG and regression algorithms. To this aim, we conducted a group of 23 participants (mean age 22.65 ± 5.48) over a stress-relax experience while monitoring their EEG. First, we stressed the participants via the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), and then we led them through a 360-degree virtual reality (VR) relaxation experience. Throughout the session, the participants reported their self-perceived stress level (SPSL) via surveys. Subsequently, we extracted spectral features from the EEG of the participants and we developed individual models based on regression algorithms to predict their SPSL. We evaluated stress regression performance in terms of the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) and the correlation coefficient (R2). The results yielded from this evaluation (MSPE = 10.62 ± 2.12, R2 = 0.92 ± 0.02) suggest that our approach predicted the stress level of the participants with remarkable performance. These results may have a positive impact in diverse areas that could benefit from stress level quantitative prediction. These areas include research fields like neuromarketing, and training of professionals such as surgeons, industrial workers, or firefighters, that often face stressful situations.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: In recent years, stress and mental health have been considered as important worldwide concerns. Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection. Methods: Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory. Results: The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100\%, 97.6\%, and 96.2\%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: In recent years, stress and mental health have been considered as important worldwide concerns. Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection.

  abstract = {The research reported in this paper studies the phenomenon of technostress, that is, stress experienced by end users of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), and examines its influence on their job satisfaction, commitment to the organization, and intention to stay. Drawing from the Transaction-Based Model of stress and prior research on the effects of ICTs on end users, we first conceptually build a nomological net for technostress to understand the influence of technostress on three variables relating to end users of ICTs: job satisfaction, and organizational and continuance commitment. Because there are no prior instruments to measure constructs related to technostress, we develop and empirically validate two second order constructs: technostress creators (i.e., factors that create stress from the use of ICTs) and technostress inhibitors (i.e., organizational mechanisms that reduce stress from the use of ICTs). We test our conceptual model using data from the responses of 608 end users of ICTs from multiple organizations to a survey questionnaire. Our results, based on structural equation modeling (SEM), show that technostress creators decrease job satisfaction, leading to decreased organizational and continuance commitment, while Technostress inhibitors increase job satisfaction and organizational and continuance commitment. We also find that age, gender, education, and computer confidence influence technostress. The implications of these results and future research directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to present an analysis of the concept of mental load from the point of view of human performance theory. In the first section the theoretical status of the concept of mental load is considered. It is concluded that it is based upon common sense, which cannot be supposed to be empirically founded in a simple way. Then an outline is given of the main procedures of measurement. The next section describes a number of theoretical bases which are all related to some kind of limited capacity notion. It is concluded that the original idea of channel capacity in terms of information theory fails to provide a sound theoretical framework. Other capacity concepts in terms of limited capacity processors and in terms of effort are described. Three types of processors are distinguished, which have different consequences for the measurement of mental load.},

  abstract = {Permanent connection to the work world as a result of new technologies raises the possibility of workday extensions and excessive workloads. The present study addresses the relationship between technology and psychological detachment from work resulting from work overload. Participants were 313 professionals from the health sector who responded to three instruments used in similar studies. Through PLS-SEM, regression and dependence analyses were developed, and through the bootstrapping method, significance of factor loadings, path coefficients and variances were examined. Results of the study corroborate a negative effect of technology use on psychological detachment from work and a positive correlation between technology and work overload. Additionally, there is a significant indirect effect of technology on psychological detachment from work as a result of work overload. Findings extend the literature related to the stressor-detachment model, and support the idea that workers who are often connected to their jobs by technological tools are less likely to reach adequate psychological detachment levels. Implications for the academic community and practitioners are discussed.},
