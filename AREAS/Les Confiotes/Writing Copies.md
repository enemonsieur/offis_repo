How should the copies of Les Confiotes be?
	1. Attention grabbin headlings
	2. looks more like an editorial than an ad (does it make it more likely to be read?)
	3. makes a specific offer
- Find a vocabulary to describe liquors
	- Look more on google
	- Look at your top competitors
	- Who are the liquors and syrups and juice top competitors
- Look for brands with good marketing on liquor and juices


- Create a template for writing copy for the Confiotes and especially titles. 
Look for multiple copies like that, not jsut because it's a good trianing but because there's no way you can get better if you don't train by that as much as possible. You and the team. Look for every good headlines for liquor and stuffs just lije us. Look for things that confirm the structure of the book copycriting
(Reading the Handbook for copywriting)
	Look for ads of your top competitor, and how to implement them

- 3 keys to write good 
	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

# Attention
It's the no.1 priority of every copy
