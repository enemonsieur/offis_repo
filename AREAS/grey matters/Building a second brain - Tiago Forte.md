	 What  job would you hire your personnal assissant for? 
		 To organize my ideas for my contents and plan the work in progress of every content

How to turn any snip
CODE framework

**Collect** only and always note things that resonate with you in a deeper level. it doesnt matter if its usefull today or later. Just write it #notetaking 
**Organize**: the best way to organize content is only with stuff  you care about now. Jote them all in the current task you're working  like your language cours or grey matters newsletter and tag them approprietly
**Distill**: as S√∂nhe Akrens said the best way to distill is to always resume the notes so that you won't have to walk through them again. You'll really just have to read few comprehensible note and don't go back into rereading. Actually. IT works for school, work, and personnal project. Having to reread stuffs just to understand what they mean is a waste of time. 
**Express**: As always, knowledge is best remember when we use it. Don't waste time hoarding notes if you're nto gonna create something. Samething with school or whatever. Always learn the way you're going to publish
#notetaking an error I've always make is not organizing the most importnat. For example my matlab. Had I organize  all my matlab file,s I'd be easily able to go trough usefull bit of coedes and snatch them back. Its extremely essential to have them well noted, and tags, and even basically organized so I can come back to them fast and learn them.
	#journaling I dont have to write everytingI want I can also just write how I briefly fell, why  I think I feel like that and what I could do to change it
	#productivity what are the most important problems I have to work on?
		How can I learn better and faster
		How do I keep my focus sharp for longer periods
		How do I connect emotions in the brain
		How do I find communities I enjoy chatting with?
		How do I make passive income
		How do I develop autosustained methods to do businesses
		How do I track my progresses and programs more efficienntly
		How do I redcude the number of setbacks I have every months?


how do I know if I should #notetaking 
	Does it inspire me? Gut feeling
	Is there a step by step process inside that I know I'd like to have so that I wont have to think in the futre? Is there a reference, a diagram that'd make my life easier?
		For example to invest money - guide of brokey, invest in NFTs

#para Use the Para method to store notes:
- Projects
- Areas (what are the things you are doing without ends?)
- Resources
- Archives

- Always try to put your notes in the most actionnable steps. Am besten, all your notes must finish into a project you're currently working on. 

Don't organize notes based on where they come from: Dont put theses current notes in your  "book fucking folder" just because It came from book. Organize them based on how currently usefull they are: Management notes, fMRI notes, neuroscience for content notes, neurosciences in general notes (ressources)

**- Quantum note taking** : Take notes that will survive the quantum jump into the future. If the insights arrive messed up and hard to find, understand, or even remember, youre future self will never give a fuck. 

# Progressive Summarization
1. Highlights 3-5% of every book
2. Take notes of the important 10-20% of them
3. Summarize the 10-20% of your notes in important points and actionable steps
![[Pasted image 20220709133821.png]]
It's based on the fact that only the most important ideas stick. But you don't have the mental energy to turn them into a good speech  for your future self, so focus on those 10-20% ideas 
-Tiago Forte. The best stuff always stick to your mind and hour or two (or a day or two)
- Test: CAN YOU GET THE GIST OF IT at a glance?
- Progressive summarization: Instead of agressively try to note every part of a book, try to capture links for article or explanations or audios from professor. Put them in the appropriate folder. 
	- Then later, find your usual links you see. Highlight the most important passages, NEVER more than 10 % of the whole stuff. And add them in a common storage. You may want to include stuff that resonate with you but you can't explain why. 
	- Then comment 20% max of those highlights in a way that'd be easy to contextualize and that your future sefl will immediately grasp

How do I make my notes more discoverable? How do I convince my futur self that does note s are worth rereading? May be by having a summary of the most important points. And the action steps. 


# Intermediate Packets
The IP are content that can be digest by a certain public, give you feedback, but don't count as a final project:
- Distilled notes: From past articles, books that you summarized
- Michael Simmons Twitter Thread, Tiktok videos resumating a focused ideas
- Past works of course, like my mini-course, my articles, it'd be super, when starting a project like publishing again on neursociences to reassamble the past projects into a PROJECT dedicated to that. 
## Resurface Past work
## How to expert your work
Use the sharing of article to friends/people asking/twitter/sharing, to resume the work into distilled notes before saving, then add them in the appropriate PARA. Friends will hlep you increase your knowledge, and you'll help them actually read and learn that shit.

 ## How do you work on stuffs?
 


 - Have a big scramble of a lot of ideas
 - When you finish writing, always jote down the next steps to work on. Be very precise on them
 - Always go for the MVP: Twitter, Tiktok. Test smalls IPs. (Intermediate Packages)

## HABITS to keep on
What most people are missing, however, is a feedback loop‚Äîa way to ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù the knowledge that was created as part of past e4orts so it can be used in future ones as well. This is how investors think about money: they don‚Äôt get the prots from one investment and immediately spend it all.
They reinvest it back into other investments, creating a flywheel so their money builds on itself over time.

This is exactly how I want you to treat your attention‚Äîas an asset that gets invested and produces a return, which in turn can be reinvested back

Checklist #1: Project Kickoff

Before they taxi onto the runway and take o4, airline pilots run through a ‚Äúpre9ight checklist‚Äù that tells them everything they need to check or do.

It ensures they complete all the necessary steps without having to rely on their unreliable brains.


## I always fail to do WEEKLY REVIEW/PLANS
What are some tips that could help me?
- Clear my notes on Ene WA, on Notes Mi
- Add every RDV


### The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer Luck

There‚Äôs a third category of habits that will come in handy as you start putting your Second Brain into action in the real world. It is in some ways the most important category, but also the least predictable.



- Noticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and capturing it instead of thinking, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

- Noticing when an idea you‚Äôre reading about resonates with you and taking those extra few seconds to highlight it.

- Noticing that a note could use a better title‚Äîand changing it so it‚Äôs easier for your future self to find it.

- Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it will be more useful.

Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into a new, larger work so you don‚Äôt have to start it from scratch.
Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the same note so it‚Äôs not spread around too many places.

- Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a problem, and sharing it with them, even if it‚Äôs not perfect.
