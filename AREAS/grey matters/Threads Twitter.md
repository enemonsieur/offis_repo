IDEAS for twitter threads

Why you shouldn't take too many notes
	1. It's easy to never enact on the notes,even if you manage to do that
	2. What's the point of writing that much, if you never review 1% of it?
	3. Most of what we remember from great  readings are the key 3-4 points that captured our minds from day one
		1. Threfore, why not just note them, and forget about the rest?
	4. Take your notes, and place them, because you think it'd be usefull for project X
	5. Don't note because it's the notes for entrepreuneurship. Your projects are constantly changign. IT's get lost in the process.

The 64/4 Rule

If you think the 80/20 is exciting, the 64/4 rule will blow your mind. You see we can apply the 80/20 rule to the rule itself. So we take 80% of 80 and 20% of 20 and end up with the 64/4 rule.

So 64% of effects come from 4% of causes
Put another way—the majority of your success comes from the top 4% of your actions. Or put yet another way
96% of the stuff you do is waste of time (comparatively)

There are various areas of your business where you could start looking for leverage points. You may look atgetting 50% better at your negotiation skills. This in turn may help you re-negotiate with key suppliers and get an incremental improvement in your buy price. While this is great, at the end of the day after all that time and effort you’ve still just improved your bottom line incrementally. This is not what I’d call massive leverage. We want exponential improvement, not incremental.
By far the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing
. If you get 10% better at marketing, this can have an exponential or multiplying effect on the bottom line.
Willie Sutton was a prolific American bank robber. During his forty-year criminal career he stole millions of dollars, and eventually spent more than half of his adult life in prison and also managed to escape three times. Sutton was asked by reporter Mitch Ohnstad why he robbed banks. According to Ohnstad, he replied,

“Because that’s where the money is.” When it comes to business the reason we want to focus so heavily on marketing is the same—because that’s where the money is.

## What are the key things that makes direct marketing work?
It’s **trackable**.

That is, when someone responds, you know which ad and which media was responsible for

generating the response. This is in direct contrast to mass media or “brand” marketing—no one will ever

know what ad compelled you to buy that can of Coke, heck you may not even know yourself.
It’s **measurable**.
Since you know which ads are being responded to and how many sales you’ve received from each one, you can measure exactly how effective each ad is. You then drop or change ads that are not giving you a return on investment.
It uses **compelling headlines** and sales copy.
Direct response marketing has a compelling message of strong interest to your chosen prospects. It uses attention-grabbing headlines with strong sales copy that is “salesmanship in print.” Often the ad looks more like an editorial than an ad (hence making it at least three times more likely to get read).

It targets a **specific audience or niche**.
Prospects within specific verticals, geographic zones or niche markets are targeted. The ad aims to appeal to a narrow target market.

It **makes a specific offer**.
Usually the ad makes a specific value-packed offer. Often the aim is not necessarily to sell anything from the ad but to simply get the prospect to take the next action, such as requesting a free report. The offer focuses on the prospect rather than on the advertiser and talks about the prospect’s interests, desires, fears and frustrations. By contrast, mass media or “brand” marketing has a broad, one-size-fits-all marketing message and is focused on the advertiser.

It **demands a response**.

Direct response advertising has a “call to action,” compelling the prospect to do something specific. It also includes a means of response and “capture” of these responses. Interested, high probability prospects have easy ways to respond such as a regular phone number, a free recorded message line, a website, a fax back form, a reply card or coupons. When the prospect responds, as much of the person’s contact information as possible is captured so that they can be contacted beyond the initial response.

**Multi-step, short-term follow-up.**

In exchange for capturing the prospect’s details, valuable education and information on the prospect’s problem is offered. The information should carry with it a second “irresistible offer”—tied to whatever next step you want the prospect to take, such as calling to schedule an appointment or coming into the showroom or store. Then a series of follow-up “touches” via different media such as mail, e-mail, fax, and phone are made. Often there is a time or quantity limit on the offer.

**Maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.**

People who do not respond within the short-term follow-
up period may have many reasons for not “maturing” into buyers immediately. There is value in this bank of slow-to-mature prospects. They should be nurtured and continue hearing from you regularly.
Direct response marketing is a very deep topic with many facets. The 1-Page Marketing Plan is a tool that helps you implement direct response marketing in your business without needing to spend years studying to become an expert.
