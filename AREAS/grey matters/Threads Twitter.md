Why you shouldn't take too many notes
	1. It's easy to never enact on the notes,even if you manage to do that
	2. What's the point of writing that much, if you never review 1% of it?
	3. Most of what we remember from great  readings are the key 3-4 points that captured our minds from day one
		1. Threfore, why not just note them, and forget about the rest?
	4. Take your notes, and place them, because you think it'd be usefull for project X
	5. Don't note because it's the notes for entrepreuneurship. Your projects are constantly changign. IT's get lost in the process.

The 64/4 Rule

If you think the 80/20 is exciting, the 64/4 rule will blow your mind. You see we can apply the 80/20 rule to the rule itself. So we take 80% of 80 and 20% of 20 and end up with the 64/4 rule.

So 64% of effects come from 4% of causes
Put another way—the majority of your success comes from the top 4% of your actions. Or put yet another way
96% of the stuff you do is waste of time (comparatively)

There are various areas of your business where you could start looking for leverage points. You may look atgetting 50% better at your negotiation skills. This in turn may help you re-negotiate with key suppliers and get an incremental improvement in your buy price. While this is great, at the end of the day after all that time and effort you’ve still just improved your bottom line incrementally. This is not what I’d call massive leverage. We want exponential improvement, not incremental.
By far the biggest leverage point in any business is marketing
. If you get 10% better at marketing, this can have an exponential or multiplying effect on the bottom line.
Willie Sutton was a prolific American bank robber. During his forty-year criminal career he stole millions of dollars, and eventually spent more than half of his adult life in prison and also managed to escape three times. Sutton was asked by reporter Mitch Ohnstad why he robbed banks. According to Ohnstad, he replied,

“Because that’s where the money is.” When it comes to business the reason we want to focus so heavily on

marketing is the same—because

that’s where the money is
