However, a maturational delay model alone is incomplete: alternate courses are suggested by differences associated with phenotypic factors, such as symptom remission/persistence and exposure to stimulant treatment. Findings from functional imaging studies point to multiple loci of abnormalities that are not limited to frontal–striatal circuitry, which is important for executive and motivational function, but also include parietal, temporal and motor cortices, and the cerebellum.

The phasic mode of dopamine transmission may “transiently activate SEEKING patterns in coincidence with specific cue- or context-dependent information, attributing to such information an incentive motivational, action-orienting effect” ([Alcaro and Panksepp, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00145/full#B2), p.1810).
=> We can build habit by connecting cues to rewards, because of the phasic part of the dopamine striatum circuit

For example, [Alcaro et al. (2007)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00145/full#B3) advanced the hypothesis that moderately high levels of tonic dopamine optimize the SEEKING behavior promoted by phasic dopamine release: when tonic levels of dopamine are too low, phasic signals lack the efficacy to promote exploration; but when tonic levels are too high, phasic signals lose their informational value and exploratory behavior patterns are uncoupled from relevant contextual stimuli.
=> How the two modes of dopamine influences exploration of cues vs. associating cues with ideas.
