However, a maturational delay model alone is incomplete: alternate courses are suggested by differences associated with phenotypic factors, such as symptom remission/persistence and exposure to stimulant treatment. Findings from functional imaging studies point to multiple loci of abnormalities that are not limited to frontalâ€“striatal circuitry, which is important for executive and motivational function, but also include parietal, temporal and motor cortices, and the cerebellum.
