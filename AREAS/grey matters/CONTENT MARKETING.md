# CONTENT MARKETING
## What to do if the niche is saturated? 
1. Find an unsaturated niche.  
2. Consistently produce a volume of quality, helpful material aimed at a relevant audience (or persona).  
3. Never stop producing content.
Dominating a niche early has extremely important long-term value because the search engines will  
continue to recognize and reward the authority your website accrues for a long time. One pioneering blogger told me that after dominating his niche with content for so long, he could probably remain at the top of most  search engines for years ... even if he never wrote another blog post again. 

**The Content Saturation Index**  
, an entrepreneur and content marketing thought leader, created a theoretical term to  
describe this condition -- “content saturation index.”1 While his social media drug of choice is blogging, his  experience relates to any content form. He described in a post:  
*“The more content an industry/niche has written about it, the harder it is for a blog to make headway  
and find success in that field. And when an industry has very little online content available to the  
masses, it can often be gobbled up within almost no time at all."*
**Marcus Sheridan**

=> So I don't know how much it applies to Facebook, Youtube, but 6 months to 3 years of consistent high-qualitly material, axed towards one persona is most important to stay in the top searchs for years.
If we do that for made in Cameroon, we can make a volume of people looking for MIC alternatives drop by our facebook and website when MIC will explode in couple of years.


## what makes a great content
*I wrote a post about social media audits and published it on my blog. It received no comments or  social activity AT ALL. I later submitted the exact same piece to the Social Media Today website. It  was tweeted hundreds of times and I also had some great responses across the blogosphere.  
So much for great content. It’s the exact same article, but since my blog doesn’t have authority or  community, it wouldn't have been found or read regardless of the quality of my work.  I think at this point the focus has to move from content creation toward the idea of building  community, developing strategies to distribute the content, and marketing to promote every piece.”  
Marcela hit on some more suspicions that point to the elusive Content Code: Regardless of quality, content  marketing success must also include community, distribution, and promotion.*  
=> People wrongly think that quality and patience are the most important for content. But having community and authority is: years ago Mark schaeffer posted an article about social media audits. No coments, no social activity at all. Then he submitted the piece to the famous website social media today. It was RT 100s of times, great responses from other blogs etc. It's not about the content quality but the content awareness.

HOW TO BREAKTHROUGH IN WINE BUSINESS
Consider one more example that points to the secrets to content marketing success in an information dense world.  
A few years ago, I was approached by a friendly fellow named Stephen Cronk for help on a new marketing strategy. Here’s a summary of his story:  
He left his corporate job in London and moved his family to the Provence region of France.  
In the teeth of a recession and with no previous wine-making experience, he started a new winery called Mirabeau. He had 600 established competitors—and that was just in Provence!  
This was a tough assignment, but I do love a challenge, and most important, I believed in Stephen. He  
possessed an excellent business mind, an urgency to learn, and a great sense of storytelling. I had to say yes!  Our first step was to determine where he could maneuver in a highly saturated, low-growth market. We  couldn’t afford to be a “me too.” We conducted a complete market and competitive analysis and discovered that among the hundreds of wineries in his region, **none of them had a meaningful digital marketing  presence.** At the same time, his potential retail customers were trying to gain a foothold in the social media space. In this intersection, we found our opportunity.  
We had to scale a content marketing effort quickly and decided that Stephen’s primary source would be video. He was a natural on camera, and the lush and ancient countryside of Provence provided an ideal backdrop to explore wine making, food, history, art, and the local color.  
Stephen consistently documented his wine-making journey in a very human and entertaining way. He  
talked about a labeling crisis that almost crushed his business. **He created entertaining videos about the ridiculous paperwork he faced from the French government, what it was like to attend an international wine-  tasting competition, and how the grapes were harvested in the early morning sunlight**. He created stories  
about his village, his pets, and his family. He shared his anguish as he knelt beside grape vines decimated by  a 13-minute hail storm. He captured the pure joy of his children dancing while on a family vacation.  
He was putting a human and modern face to a stodgy, traditional business.  
In addition to producing content, we also had a network strategy and continuously worked on building a  wine-loving audience that was passionate about his product and the stories from his little family business. As  his audience and engagement multiplied, Stephen was able to share this data with huge wine retailers to  prove a point of differentiation. No winemaker in the region had the presence and audience that the upstart  Mirabeau had. The strategy worked, and the orders started coming in.  
Stephen followed our strategy to dominate this unsaturated content niche and his progress was steady.  
But on his 222nd video, Stephen found the gold at the end of the rainbow. In just 29 seconds, he  
demonstrated how to open a wine bottle with only his shoe.6 That video has now attracted well over 9 million  views ... one of the greatest small business video success stories in the history of the web!  
The viral attention gave a significant lift to all the content on the site. Because Stephen had worked so  
long and hard to provide entertaining videos, the viral visitors stuck around to see what else he had for them.  
Since the “shoe video,” the winery’s “About Mirabeau” video on its YouTube channel has received more than  10,000 new views. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and newsletter subscriptions have had massive  
gains.  
The tiny winery received immense media attention from both the mainstream press and wine industry  
bloggers who marveled at Stephen’s authentic and human storytelling:

##  Guidelines to find a un-saturated market
If there are fewer than 10,000 pages of returned search results, full speed ahead! There’s an opportunity  for you since there is low content density.
Between 10,000 and 100,000 results, expect some resistance, but it’s surmountable with minimal  
investment, exceptional content, and implementation of some of the Content Code factors covered in  
this book.  
If there are between 100,000 and 1 million search results, expect significant resistance. Competing  
through content alone will be difficult. Applying Content Code strategies might be the primary means of rising above this level of saturation.  

A result producing more than 1 million pages of content represents a thoroughly saturated niche. Unless  the content becomes a product in its own right through significant investment, Content Shock exists in this niche and is likely to bury even exceptional content creation efforts. In this situation, the Content Code strategies would be the only possibility of strategic leverage.  
Examining the relative saturation in your niche is crucial to understanding how the Content Code formula will or will not work for your market. It’s extremely difficult to unseat somebody in the search engine ranking if they have dominated a niche, even if you’re doing great work. But it’s not hopeless.  
Of course the strategies in this book are going to work well in an environment where the content  
competition is still relatively low. If you’re fortunate enough to already own an unsaturated content niche, chances are you’ll dominate the search engine rankings too, and the Content Code will widen the gap between you and the laggards.  
However, if you’re behind in your market and you’re feeling like it’s “game over,” the Content Code can  
provide you with an ignition strategy and an entirely new opportunity to maneuver.  

## 3 types of content you need for your brand
2. Explore different types of content.  
YouTube first floated the idea 2 that different types of content, when combined together in an ideal mix, are  extremely successful in building an engaged audience for the long-term. The three types of content are:  
### Hygiene content: Juices (Hilaire stuff)
This is the content that serves the daily health of your audience. This content makes  
them aware of your brand and helps them connect to you when they need you most. This is the specific,  short-form content that is most likely to turn up in organic search results. An example of hygiene  content is a series of how-to videos from a do-it-yourself store like Home Depot.
=> Short form contenu, How to, 10 things to...
### Hub content: Snacks (reuse, list, stories)
While hygiene content might get somebody to your site, hub content is intended to keep  
them there. This could be a series of articles about a more in-depth topic, or perhaps a serialized story,  
that makes people want to go down the rabbit hole and stay on your site. This could also be “evergreen” content that people seem to love and read month after month. An example of hub content is the  addictive and thrilling adventure videos produced by Adidas Outdoor featuring daredevil athletes using their gear. Hub content lifts subscriptions to your content, spurs engagement, builds brand interest, and  may even lead to brand loyalty.  
=> Content that make people stay, read. In-depth, multi article
### Hero content: M. simmons
Hero content is something brilliant, dramatic, and bold that transcends the normal day-  
to-day Internet offerings. This is the content that creates viral buzz. A famous example is the epic videos  Nike created to celebrate the World Cup. The most recent one, “Winner Stays,” playfully captures the  schoolyard fantasy of young soccer players who morph into their favorite global stars. This type of  content is difficult to produce. Nike was intentional in spending millions to create this hero content with  the goal of creating massive brand awareness and dominating the conversation around the world’s  biggest sporting event. The video received 100 million views.
=> Video Ads de haute qualité. Crée une massive brand awareness

## The six elements of the Content Code  
We’ve established that great content is rarely enough to assure success. Great content is simply the table stakes needed to earn a seat at the table. I’m not going to cover tips and tricks about writing for the web or  creating epic videos. Those topics have already been effectively covered in many other places. We’re here to plow new ground.  
**So here is the starting line for this race: You need great content.  
Let me repeat: You need great content. But then what?**  
This is where the Content Code takes over. Content that rises and is discovered through search is a  
mixture of art, science, and magic that includes these six factors:  
1- B rand development  
2- A udience and Influencers  
3- D istribution, Advertising, Promotion, and SEO  
4- A uthority  
5- S hareability embedded into each piece of content
6- S ocial proof and social signals  
Now, if you’re paying close attention—and I’m sure you are—the first letter of each piece of the Content Code spells out BADASS.  
I consider this a giddy coincidence and perhaps the highlight of my professional career. I’m tempted to end the book right now as I’m sure there is nothing I can write that can ever top this. I bet you didn’t see that coming did you? You should send me a selfie right now with the look of surprise and amazement on your  
face. #BadassSelfie  
Okay, time to settle down. We must get back to the topic at hand, for this is a serious book for serious  
people. What does this BADASS thing really mean?  
**Provided you start with great content (did I already mention that?), if you commit to continuously working**  
on these six factors you’ll begin to crack the code. Although the six factors have been written 
about inbits and pieces by many talented experts (whom I call on to help tell the story), this is the first time the entire Content Code has been assembled in a cohesive way, in one book.  
In the chapters that follow, we will dive into each of these factors in detail, but the overall recipe for how you execute your plan is up to you. You see, there’s no simple strategy that fits everybody ...  
A business competing **to sell discrete items in an eCommerce environment will want to emphasize brand building and search optimization.**  
**A lawyer, management consultant, or accountant will probably want to focus on establishing authority and a large, engaged audience consisting of consumers of their services.**  
A company in a highly competitive international market may need to spend money on promotion and  
advertising to get their message through.  
**An individual starting a blog might seek a true balance of all six factors but concentrate on writing highly shareable content and building a heroic personal brand that leads to fanatic supporters and business** benefits. 
So the best way to use this book is to take a dive into all six pools and see what fits for your particular  
situation. You don’t necessarily need to work on all six factors to make progress. Pick out one or two that fit your business situation and capabilities, and you certainly will be better prepared for the future than your
=> Concerning Ro, what we need is a good amount of shareability, we also need brand development unfortunately, but not until we are done with the labels/packaging
# SHAREABILITY 
=> Content isn't effective if it doesn't move people. We are not in condition to not create great content. We have to be able to create content that makes people want to talk about Les Confiotes, because if they truly connect with it, they'll want to interact, or share it to their friends (which are probably our target market)
Here’s the mistake most companies make: **They check the box on content and then forget about ignition.  introduced in Chapter 1, content isn’t effective if it doesn’t move.** People have to see it, engage with it, share it—or you’re wasting your money. By putting the emphasis on exposing your content instead of simply producing more, more, more, you create a powerful new marketing competency in the information era.  
This is where we’re going to spend our time for the rest of this book. You’ll become an expert on this  
complex cocktail of ideas and insights, promotion and production, audience and audacity ... that gets your  content to explode through this wall of information density.  

**=> How to know if a content is worth sharing?**
Think about when you shared content. Hilaire, think about you sharing music video of devil may cry or Crazy job posts on reddit, etc..: It was funny, crazy, by sharing it, you knew people like you will react, also find it crazy, share your feeling. Even if they didn't, at least you knew by doing it over and over, they'll see you as the "Job-post" guy, making you the go-to person for this kind of thing.
Sometimes, you share content, not because it's usefull for you, but because it could be for other people, and it makes you look good to your peer (you'll share 10 tools for excels, because it could be use useful, even if you don't use it.)

It made you look cooler, smarter, funnier, or more relevant—providing you with a personal psychological  benefit.  The content struck some **strong emotional chord**. It made you laugh, cry, or otherwise feel something so  profound it deserved to be shared with others.  
**It’s practical or timely.** Sharing the content will help and inform your friends.  
You found **a new idea** and can’t wait to be the first to share it.  
You feel deeply connected to the author and you want to support them.  
It represents an achievement. **Maybe you or your company were mentioned in** the content and it makes  you feel good to show this representation of your status.

Research shows that people typically don’t share content they’re reading on the web, even “great”  
content.1 For example, a large study of social transmission across millions of Twitter accounts revealed that  the majority of users are passive information consumers and rarely forward content to their network.  
In fact, **an average Twitter user retweets only one in 318 content links they receive**. Facebook reports that just one-half of one percent of those who see a Facebook post share it.2 These sobering numbers suggest that actively finding and nurturing that miniscule number of the most active users is critical to spreading your information on the web.

**Therefore, in order to become an effective content-igniter, you must not only create content and build an  audience but also employ strategies to overcome user passivity and systematically find individuals  predisposed to love and share the content you’re creating. This is perhaps the most overlooked  imperative in digital marketing today.**  
=> To make your content viral, you have to move people enough to make them wanna have action, and orient the content to the people most likely to share that content (your market target, but also people that have a "sharing" personnality1)

## 5 reasons to overcome disinteress and share content
To be useful. The number one reason people share content is to bring valuable and entertaining  
content to others. More than 90 percent of study participants said they carefully consider how the  
information they share will be useful to the recipient.  
To define ourselves to others. Nearly 70 percent of participants said they share content to give  
people a better sense of who they are and what they care about. One respondent said, “I try to share  
information that will reinforce the image I’d like to present—thoughtful, reasoned, kind, interested, and  
passionate about certain things.”  
To grow and nourish relationships. About 80 percent of participants share information online  
because it lets them stay connected to people they may not otherwise stay in touch with. A little over 70  
percent share content to help connect them to new people who share common interests.  
Self-fulfillment. About 70 percent of participants share content because it allows them to feel more  
involved in the world. The act of getting positive feedback on shares makes people feel valued.  
To get the word out about causes and brands. More than 80 percent of participants said they  
share content to rally others around a cause, company, or idea they believe in.

As you read this list, it probably occurs to you that sharing content is a meaningful act, a very personal,  
intimate, and important gesture. It’s not at all trivial.  
The decision to share content is often a sign of a relationship. A relationship with the source, a relationship  
with a network...even a relationship between the person and the content! Igniting content is a symbol of  kindness and caring and a reflection of who we are.  
Pretty deep stuff.  
One of my blog readers recently sent me this note:  
“Your blog has become part of my morning routine. I start my day with a cup of coffee and your latest  
blog post! I almost always share your posts with my friends because I feel like I know you. Your  
perspective aligns with my business values and I feel good about sharing your thoughts with others  
... and even with family members.”  
There is a lot of rich insight in this brief message:  
My content has connected to her on an emotional level, and I’ve become part of the fabric of her life.  
Although I’ve never met this person or even spoken to her on the phone, she feels as if she knows me as  
a friend. She has built a kinship with me through my content alone.  
Sharing my content is an act of adding value to her friends. It enhances her self-view because my values  
reflect her values. And the bond created through my words is so strong that she feels comfortable  
making me part of her family communications at times.  
I’ve built “shareability” into my content over time by nurturing a relationship of trust with the reader. I  
can’t appeal to everyone, of course—there are people who unsubscribe to my blog all the time. But for those  
who do connect, they seem to connect deeply.

**Sharing creates involved, smarter consumers**  
Sharing content isn’t just about building “traffic.” The act of sharing content actually helps consumers  
process your information better. A separate New York Times study4 on why and how people share content  
found that:  
73 percent of participants say they process information “more deeply, thoroughly, and thoughtfully”  
when they share it.  
85 percent say reading content that other people share helps them understand and process information  
and events.  
49 percent say sharing allows them to inform others of products they care about and potentially change  
opinions or encourage action.  
Participants say the act of sharing content helps them remember products and information sources better  
and makes them more likely to use them. So if you create ideal conditions for content-sharing, you both build  
power for your brand and create new economic value by helping your consumers understand you and  
become authentic advocates for your products and ideas!

## WEARABLE CONTENT
**If you’re one of the spectacular readers who tweet or post about this book to your audience, it’s probably  
because what I’ve written creates a connection that is psychologically consistent with what you believe and  
how you want to present yourself to others. Sharing an idea from this book makes a statement about you,  
just like your choice in jeans, car, or a soft drink. It says, I concur. I am aligned. I think this author is smart,  
and I am smart; therefore, I will share it. This book is cool, and I am cool, so I will share it.  
Your content becomes part of your audience’s personal narrative.**
=>I am Madango et j'approuve ce message. I'm Yvon, Marie-Ester, Ace and j'approuve ce message
=> Create WEARABLE CONTENT People will feel proud to endorse, and they'll share it. 

A generation of “me-formers”  
Those emotion-focused conversations are already out there by the millions. About 50 percent of what people  
talk about on social media is “me” focused.6 It’s more than just vanity. Studies show we’re literally hard-  
wired to talk about ourselves. Harvard neuroscientists Jason Mitchell and Diana Tamir 7 discovered that  
disclosing information about ourselves is intrinsically rewarding. They found that sharing personal opinions  
activates the same brain circuits that respond to rewards like food and money. In another study by these  
researchers, they demonstrated that the power to share about ourselves is so important people are actually  
willing to pay money to do it.
## 2. Help people achieve something with your content.  
A second point in the Berger research on social currency explains why status translates into social  
transmission:  
“Just like many other animals, people care about hierarchy. Apes engage in status displays and dogs try to  
figure out who is the alpha. Humans are no different. We like feeling that we’re high status, top dog, or leader  
of the pack. But status is inherently relational. Being the leader of the pack requires a pack, and doing better  
than others.”  
He suggests that building game mechanics into your content strategy might push people into transmission  
mode. Examples of content activities that bestow accomplishment include:  
Achieving a status level  
Winning an award  
Being included on a “best of” list  
Getting a high score on a quiz  
Being favorably mentioned in a video, podcast, or post  
Achieving status helps generate social currency and social sharing. After all, what good is accomplishing  
something if you can’t tell people about it?  
Word of mouth also can come from the voting process itself. Deciding the winner by popular vote  
encourages contestants to drum up support. But in telling people to vote for them, contestants also spread  
awareness about the product sponsoring the contest. Instead of marketing yourself directly, you use the  
contest to get people who want to win to do the marketing themselves.  
One of the most interesting competitions I’ve seen is the “Top Social Media Blog Contest” compiled by  
Social Media Examiner, one of the top sites on the marketing scene. The unique aspect of this blog is that it

Another common tool for creating personal achievement through content is quizzes, which explains why  
they appear on so many sites that depend on advertising for their revenues. In 2014, eight of the 10 most-  
shared articles on the entire Internet were quizzes. Sharing positive or funny quiz results fuels our identity  
and ego. Others learn more about who we are, what we value, and our tastes.  
MIT cultural analyst Sherry Turkle11 says that people turn to quizzes to fulfill an irresistible need to quantify  
the human condition. “Basically, we’re trying to get a number,” she said. “And people will use a quiz to get  
that number. It gives people something to look at, an object to think with.” She adds that people have always  
loved quizzes, but in the pre-social media days, we primarily took them for ourselves. “Now they’re  
specifically for performance,” she said. “Part of the point is to share it ... It’s the conflation of who you are and  
who thinks you’re okay.”  
So when you’re making quizzes for your audience, you’re giving them an opportunity to learn something  
interesting about themselves and a chance to start a conversation with their friends. It’s hard to say that  
about a lot of other forms of content.  

## type of people more likely to ignite your content
Altruists: Altruistic sharers are people who want to be seen as helpful and reliable. They’re thoughtful  
and well-connected. Their primary method for sharing content is through email.  
Careerists: Careerists want to be seen as valuable and upwardly-mobile. They want to share content  
that makes them seem intelligent and well-connected. A primary platform for them is LinkedIn.  
Hipsters: Hipsters regard content sharing as an integral part of who they are. They’re the least likely  
group to use email and lean toward Twitter and emerging social media platforms. This is a youthful  
group who wants to be seen as creative and cutting edge.  
Boomerangs: Boomerangs are highly validated by the reactions they get from their posts. They want to  
be provocative and earn attention through the reactions of others. They’re heavy users of both Twitter  
and Facebook.  
Connectors: Connectors are social butterflies who love to bring people and ideas together. They’re  
planners who are typically relaxed, creative, and thoughtful. They most often share content through  
email and Facebook.  
Selectives: As the name implies, Selectives don’t share with vast social audiences. They will share a  
piece of content with select individuals who they think would benefit from it, usually via email. They’re  
resourceful, careful, and informed and want to be seen as useful and thoughtful.  
How can you create content that will appeal to these personas? Are there standard processes you can build  
into your content to make it more likely to ignite? That’s what the next chapter is all about!

# PRACTICAL WAYS TO IGNITE (IDEAS)
1. Always ask to share.
Make it as easy as possible to share everything everywhere all at once.
Ex: Hilaire sur Facebook comment faire que les gens partagent?
Whatsapp Eunice: Dire que vous pouvez poster en statut. Make it status-poster friendly
A recent study2 showed that content with sharing buttons is 700 percent more likely  
to spread than content without those buttons.

## 2. Give everything for free but scattered
Business relationships are built on trust. They always have been. But for centuries you were limited by time  
and geography. You could only create trust with those who actually knew you—and probably within a pretty  
small area. The social web is an incredible gift to businesses everywhere. For the first time in history, you can  
create relationships and build trust with people far and wide ... through your voice, your views, and your  
expertise. But the only way to do that is by giving them enough free content to know you and trust you.  
When I started my consulting business, I took all the business I could get on a regional level. Slowly my  
business evolved and grew, completely on the back of my blog content. And now I have connections all over  
the world through social media. In fact, I’ve never spent one dime on any form of advertising for my  
consulting business. In other words, my business has grown only because I give everything away!  
Unlock your content. Unleash it. Tear down those walls. And watch your business grow!

## 3. DON'T Just provide Value. Entertain. You're here for. 
Look at Sense of Mind. He pour so much energy, but why should I watch his content instead of reading an article? don't just provide value. Entertain. Make them laugh, make it easy, memorable, Aweing. Rich in stories, personal. Surprising. Unexpected

Research into the most-shared articles on the web 4 uncovers  
three primary emotions in the content:  
Awe (25%)  
Laughter (17%)  
Amusement/entertainment (15%)  
Pew Research5 reports that 35 percent of men and 43 percent of women are on Facebook primarily to see entertaining or funny posts.

Make it inspiring also. WTF does it mean?

Research by the company AgoraPulse7 found that the most-shared posts on Facebook also had some  
element of inspiration in them, indicated by keywords like:  
**Give**: Offers, discounts, deals, or contests that can benefit a wide audience.  
Advice: Tips, especially about problems that everyone encounters. Examples are how to lose weight or  
how to choose a college.  
Warning: Posts about dangers that could affect anyone in your audience.  
Inspire: Inspirational quotes. Love them or hate them, they work.  
Unite: Posts that highlight a danger, an evil, an enemy, a cause, or a personal or community need.  
And while we’re at it, the research also showed content behaviors that shut down social sharing (don’t do  
these!):  
Only talking about yourself  
Being too edgy or offensive  
Being too obscure or niche  
Publishing content nobody can understand  
Asking for Likes  

4.IGNITE CONVERSATIONS

 5. Work on the headline (first 30s)
 6. A lot of lists + Infographics
The BuzzSumo research of 100 million posts also showed that you double your chances that people will share  
your content if it includes a list or an infographic. It makes sense. Both list posts and infographics add an  
element of intrigue and fun while still promising quick answers. Because of their skimmable format, they  
satisfy our curiosity quickly in an information-dense environment.  
Bonus tip: A list article with the number 10 in the headline is the best number for social transmission,  
scoring four times the social shares as the next nearest number in the study. After the number 10, list  
headlines with an odd-number get shared 20 percent more than even-numbered posts.13  

 Resurface old projects, Cross publish them, Modify them

I thought this would make a provocative blog post14 and I had some fun with the headline: “Why 100,000  
People Unfollowed Me on Twitter.” But it was also a very helpful post that answered a lot of questions people  
had about this strange behavior.  
Here are the total social sharing statistics (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+) for the post:  
Month of Publication Total Number of Shares  
April 2013 378  
September 2013 654  
December 2013 1,012  
March 2014 1,144  
September 2014 1,858  
January 2015 2,020  
How is this possible? If most blog posts die after four days, how did this content keep chugging and  
chugging, finding new fans for years?  
There’s a lot of sharing potential stored in content that is always relevant and useful. This evergreen  
content answers your customers’ most common questions and rarely goes out-of-date. For example, a  
“Mommy Jogger” blog would feature evergreen content that describes the correct use of jogging strollers.  
This post would be useful and relevant to customers for years ... and could also be re-posted as new people  
look for the content.  
And that is exactly what I did. I could see that my “Un-follow” post was popular, evergreen content that  
people enjoyed, so I tweeted the link out to my audience about once a month. And each time I did, it received  
more comments and social shares. A lot more!  

### 8. Focus on feedback and reviews.
Another important form of social transmission is feedback and reviews. Reviews offer powerful “social proof”  
that can make or break a business. This concept is covered extensively in Chapter 9 but in short, social proof  
is an accumulation of the clues in our environment we use to make decisions when we don’t know the truth.  
Reviews are a good example of this idea. If we have never visited a business before, we may turn to this  
crowd-sourced content to decide whether to buy something or not.  
For many businesses, online reviews are a high-stakes component of consumer decision-making. Car  
shoppers, for example, are increasingly relying on Yelp and other ratings sites. **Nielsen reports  that 84 percent of people say that online reviews influence their buying decision.** These reviewers can even gain  celebrity status as their opinions reverberate throughout Twitter, Facebook, and beyond.  
The key with this tactic is to have a rock-solid internal process for capturing and maintaining a steady  
stream of customers willing to write reviews. Understandably, **many of your frontline sales personnel may feel awkward about asking for a review, but you can put it in a way that makes the customer comfortable: “Our business is based on referrals.** Would you take a moment to visit Yelp and refer us to your friends and  family?” This is a great start to your internal process, but it’s only the beginning.  

Here are several ways to improve social transmission through Yelp and other review sites:  
**Designate someone to take ownership of your implementation plan. This person is in charge of  
your online reputation and is responsible for getting grassroots participation from your staff, as well as monitoring and responding to the community.**  

Use signage and memos . Create awareness with your customers and your staff. Display “**Love Us on  
Yelp!”** signs throughout the store—entryways, sales offices, customer waiting area, customer service,  
and check-out.
=> Ask people to like our facebook, google maps (with QR CODE), 
Give customers a card to take with them that reminds them you’re on Yelp. Put memos  
on paychecks, repair orders, and invoices to create awareness.  
=> Put memos on our emballages (Personnalize emballages?)

**Reach out to your raving fans. Every salesperson has them, especially those who have been with  
you a long time**. **Ask fans to share an honest review**—don’t push for positive reviews, per se. Many  
brands fail to feature testimonials and brand evangelists on their websites and social media profiles.  
=> Put our top best testimonials on Whatsapp. Put their names.

People love attention and special treatment—the customers you feature will likely become even  
stronger supporters of your brand. Plus, showcasing objective opinions on your website may increase  
your credibility among potential customers.  
**Consider hosting a customer of the week program on your blog and on social media. Feature  
a story and testimonial from one of your satisfied customers**.  
Hold a monthly contest with the staff. Nothing motivates like a cash prize! For example, if the store  
gets 20 reviews by the end of the month, you’ll draw a name and that person wins the cash.  
Recognize staff members who get 5-star reviews. A gift or a nice mention during the weekly sales

meeting goes a long way. When the other employees see it, they’ll be eager to be recognized, too.

## 9. Make sure everythign you send is immediatly implementable. Practical. Always.
In Chapter 1, I recounted the story of the Mirabeau Miracle. The winery’s proprietor, Stephen Cronk, made  
YouTube history with a 90-second video showing how to open a wine bottle with his shoe.  
This was not epic content. It wasn’t even original. The trick had been done multiple times before on  
YouTube. The Mirabeau case study doesn’t seem to follow any rules about emotion or storytelling. But it’s an  
amazing, well-executed little demonstration, and it was a practical, useful tip.  
In the book Contagious, Jonah Berger explains, “Today, direct opportunities to help others are few and far  
between. Modern suburban life has distanced us from our friends and neighbors. We live at the end of a long  
driveway or high up in an apartment building, often barely getting to know the person next door.
People love to help their friends save money, so building extraordinary value or a deal into your content is  
a way to help it move. Not surprisingly, the bigger the perceived deal or the more exclusive it appears, the  
more the content moves.


Curation is another good way to provide practical content. Curating or summarizing valuable content by  
industry, career discipline, or interest saves people time because you’ve done the work to filter content for  
them. In the pharmaceutical industry, summaries of new surgical or medical breakthroughs are a good way to  
bond with doctors and provide truly useful information. Several wealth management companies curate global  
financial information to make the world of investing less complicated. You can find opportunities to curate  
along any interest you can imagine.

### 10. Make it look good.  
How your site looks is an important indicator of whether your content is share-worthy. When you head out for  
a night of fine dining, you don’t expect an expensive steak to arrive in a Styrofoam container with a packet of  
ketchup. And you expect premium content to look like premium content, too.  
Everything communicates, and if you don’t have the proper container for your content, you might be killing  
your transmission effort before it starts. Your site is your front door to the world and the first impression that  
might determine whether somebody leaves right away or stays long enough to find out what you’re up to.  
Remember that social sharing is often an extension of self-identity. If your site is classy, people will feel  
classy about promoting it. If your site looks trashy ... well ... it might be time for a re-fresh!

On a related note, have you checked your Google Analytics recently to see how many customers are  
accessing your site via a mobile device? You may be surprised! Make sure your site is optimized to serve  
your customers in a mobile environment. Content consumers make quick decisions about sharing, and if it’s  
difficult to accomplish or your sharing buttons aren’t obvious in a mobile environment, you’ll lose those  
precious opportunities.  

### 11. Concentrate on brand new research and ideas.  
Remember that many of your readers share content because of the intrinsic value of helping others. Focusing  
your content on new insights from research, quotes from experts, and exciting new ideas will appeal to this psychological aspect of sharing.  
This is also a source of rich content creation ideas. When you see a particularly compelling piece of  
research, quote it, provide proper links and attribution, and then give it your own spin:
This is also a source of rich content creation ideas. When you see a particularly compelling piece of  
research, quote it, provide proper links and attribution, and then give it your own spin:  
What did you learn from this new research?  
What new ideas did this enable?  
Was the research done correctly, or is there a problem with the methodology you need to highlight?  
How can the research be practically applied to problems in your industry?  
What surprised you? What doesn’t make sense? How does the research provide a new world view?  
All of these personal spins on data can make compelling original content highly valued by your most  
passionate audience members.

## 18. ENCOURAGE COMMENTS.  
People who care enough to leave comments on the content you publish are also highly likely to share it with  
their networks. If they spend the time to leave an opinion on your work, they want the world to know it, too!  
To the extent that you can encourage comments, you’re encouraging social sharing.  
Here are some easy ways to encourage people to comment:  
End your post with a question. People hate an open-ended post and are more likely to close the loop by  
answering your question in a comment.  
Ask specifically for comments. In Chapter 7, I cover the importance of comments and social proof, but  
prime the pump by asking a few friends and work colleagues to leave a comment. Comments spur  
comments. People feel better about leaving their views when they see they’re not standing all alone in  
the comment section.  
Mention influencers with large audiences in your post and link to their content. Most of the time they will be “pinged” when someone links to their content, but don’t be afraid to let them know the link exists.  
=> Grey matters. Find the top people in your **micro niche**. Try to interact with them => ADHD, get disciplined, Focus... find them. Look for them
They’ll probably share your post.  
Notify potential commenters. Send an email to people in your industry who would be interested in your  
post. You need to use this method judiciously—you can’t keep going to the well until it’s dry! If they  
trust you and the request, you’ll almost certainly earn a comment and a share from these connections. 

19. Tap into FOMO  
Many people are obsessed with being constantly connected to the web due to a Fear of Missing Out (or  
FOMO). Tapping into this fear can also get people to click and share.  
Here’s an example of FOMO in action:19 Marc and Angel Chernoff have an incredible blog at  
www.marcandangel.com. They publish inspiring content that regularly spreads across social media,  
garnering thousands if not hundreds of thousands of social shares. One of the most fascinating pieces they’ve  
written is a post called “30 Things to Stop Doing to Yourself” that received more than 500,000 Likes, 20,000  
tweets, and several thousand shares on other social networks.

20. Help readers spread ideas to help others.  
Here’s an insight from my favorite newspaper, The New York Times :20 In an attempt to understand what’s  
buzzworthy, neuroscientists scanned the brains of people while they were hearing about new ideas. Then, as  
these people told others about what they had heard, the scientists observed which ideas spread and which  
didn’t.  
You might predict that people would pass along the most memorable ideas—the ones that light up the  
brain regions associated with memories. But that’s not what happened. The best predictors of buzz were in  
the brain regions associated with social cognition—thoughts about other people. If those regions lit up when  
something was heard, people were more likely to talk about the idea enthusiastically, and the idea would  
keep spreading.  
“You’d expect people to be most enthusiastic spreading ideas that they themselves are excited about,”  
said researcher Dr. Emily Falk of the University of Michigan. “But our research suggests that’s not the whole  
story. Thinking about what appeals to others may be even more important.”
