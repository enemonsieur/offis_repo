How should the copies of Les Confiotes be?
	1. Attention grabbin headlings
	2. looks more like an editorial than an ad (does it make it more likely to be read?)
	3. makes a specific offer
- Find a vocabulary to describe liquors
	- Look more on google
	- Look at your top competitors
	- Who are the liquors and syrups and juice top competitors
- Look for brands with good marketing on liquor and juices


- Create a template for writing copy for the Confiotes and especially titles. 
Look for multiple copies like that, not jsut because it's a good trianing but because there's no way you can get better if you don't train by that as much as possible. You and the team. Look for every good headlines for liquor and stuffs just lije us. Look for things that confirm the structure of the book copycriting
(Reading the Handbook for copywriting)
	Look for ads of your top competitor, and how to implement them

- 3 keys to write good 
	- For decades, I always told clients more is better than less. But now I am rethinking that position. Sometimes  there are thousands of articles on the topic. (I just googled “weight loss” and in less than a second was given  links to nearly two million pages.) If I gave all two million articles on weight loss a careful reading or even a  quick scan, I could not possibly make my copy deadline.

How can you enhance the 1st impression of your copy?
- front cover for the catalogue
- First 20s of a video (even first 6)
- Headline+visual


The headline is the most important element in most advertisements. It is the telegram which decides whether the  
reader will read the copy.  
On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your  
headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.  
If you haven’t done some selling in your headline, you have wasted 80 percent of your client’s money.  
Ogilvy says that putting a new headline on an existing ad has increased the selling power of the ad tenfold. I  
have experienced similar results. What is it that makes one headline a failure and the other a success?  
Many copywriters fall into the trap of believing that clever wordplay, puns, and “cute” copy make for a good  
headline. But think a minute. When you make a purchase, do you want to be amused by the sales clerk? Or do  
you want to know that you’re getting quality merchandise at a reasonable price?

## how do deliver as much message with headlines
Your headline can perform four different tasks:  
1. Get attention.  
2. Select the audience.  
3. Deliver a complete message.  
4. Draw the reader into the body copy.  

Let’s take a look at how headlines perform each of these jobs.  
## 1. Getting Attention  

“Give Your Kids a Fighting Chance” Crest  
“Why Swelter Through Another Hot Summer?” GE air conditioners  
“For Deep-Clean, Oil-Free Skin, Noxzema Has the Solution” Noxzema moisturizer  

**Give novelty:**
Another effective attention-getting gambit is to give the reader news. Headlines that give news often use words such as new, discover, introducing, announcing, now, it’s here, at last, and just arrived.  “New Sensational Video Can Give You Thin Thighs Starting  Now!” Exercise  “Discover Our New Rich-Roasted Taste” Decaffeinated  
coffee.
=>Confiotes: Découvrer nos 3 nouveaux produits que les bartender s'arrachent!

**Give Free gift**
If you can legitimately use the word free in your headline, do so. Free is one of the most powerful words in  the copywriter’s vocabulary. Everybody wants to get something for free.  
Other powerful attention-getting words include how to, why, you, sale, quick, easy, bargain, last chance, guarantee, results, proven, and save. D**o not avoid these words because other copywriters use them with such frequency.** Other copywriters use these words because they work. You should, too. Grade your performance as  
a copywriter on sales generated by your copy, not on originality.  

**Useful actionnable information**
Headlines that offer the reader useful information are also attention getters. The information promised in the headline can be given in the copy or in a free booklet the reader can send for. 
*Some examples:*
	“Free New Report on 67 Emerging Growth  
	Stocks” Merrill Lynch  
	“Three Easy Steps to Fine Wood Finishing” Minwax Wood Finish  
	“How to Bake Beans” Van Camp’s  

Many advertisers try to get attention with headlines and gimmicks that **don’t promise the reader a benefit or  are not related to the product in any way.**

When you write a headline, get attention by picking out an important customer benefit or concern and  presenting it in a clear, bold, dramatic fashion. Avoid headlines and concepts that are cute, clever, and  titillating but irrelevant. They may generate some hoopla, but they do not sell.  

## 2. Selecting the Audience  
In the same way, an ad for a $95,000 sports car should imply, “This is for rich  folks only!” You don’t want to waste time answering inquiries from people who cannot afford the product.  
The headline can select the right audience for your ad and screen out those readers who are not potential customers. A good headline for a life insurance ad might read, “To Men and Women over 65 Who Need Affordable Life Insurance Coverage.”  

“A Message to All Charter Security Life Policyholders of Single Premium Deferred  
Annuities”  
“Is Your Electric Bill Too High?” Utility ad  
“Can you trust solar heating companies you never heard of who try to sell you solar roof  
panels over the phone?” Solar panels  

## 3. Delivering a Complete Message  
Sell a complete message because those n-words won't even read through.
Here are a few headlines that deliver complete messages:  
“Caught Soon Enough, Early Tooth Decay Can Actually Be Repaired by Colgate!”  
“Hitachi Chiller-Heater Cuts Cooling and Heating Costs Up to 50%”  
“Allstate—with accident insurance, they guarantee your car insurance rates won’t go up because of an accident.”  
Ogilvy recommends that you include the selling promise and the brand name in the headline. Many effective  
headlines don’t include the product name. But put it in if you suspect most of your prospects won’t bother to read the copy underneath. For instance, having the product name in the headline or subhead in a half-page  newspaper ad for health offers typically boosts response.  

## 4. Drawing the Reader into the Body Copy  
**Certain product categories—liquor, soft drinks, and fashion, for example—can be sold with an attractive photo,  a powerful headline, and a minimum of words.** 
LES CONFIOTES

 
To draw the reader into the body copy, you must arouse his or her curiosity. You can do this with news, or  intrigue, or mystery. You can ask a question or make a provocative statement. You can promise a reward, news, or useful information.  

 “What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?” Naturally, American  managers wanted to find out about the techniques the Japanese use to run their businesses so effectively.  
 
  **a facial lotion reads**: “The $5 Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.” The reader is lured into the ad to satisfy her curiosity about what this inexpensive alternative might be. The  
headline would not have been as successful if it said, “$5 Bottle of Lotion Is an Inexpensive Alternative to Costly Plastic Surgery.”  

## Headlines examples
1. Ask a question in the headline.  
“What Do Japanese Managers Have That American Managers Sometimes Lack?”  
2. Tie-in to current events.

Times Longer.”  
4. Give news using the words “new,” “introduction,” or “announcing.”  
“Announcing a Painless Cut in Defense Spending.”  
5. Give the reader a command—tell him to do something.

“Who Ever Heard of 17,000 Blooms from a Single Plant?”
7. Promise the reader useful information.

—and Out of Uncle Sam’s.”  
16. State the selling proposition directly and plainly.  
“Surgical Tables Rebuilt—Free Loaners Available.”  
17. Arouse reader curiosity.  
“The One Internet Stock You MUST Own Now. Hint: It’s NOT What You Think!”  
18. Promise to reveal a secret.  
“Unlock Wall Street’s Secret Logic.”

21. Add a time element.  
“Instant Incorporation While U-Wait.”  
22. Stress cost savings, discounts, or value.  
“Now You Can Get $2,177 Worth of Expensive Stock Market Newsletters for the Incredibly Low Price of  
Just $69!”  
23. Give the reader good news.  
“You’re Never Too Old to Hear Better.”  
24. Offer an alternative to other products and services.  
“No Time for Yale—Took College at Home Online.”  
25. Issue a challenge.  
“Will Your Scalp Stand the Fingernail Test?”  
26. Stress your guarantee.  
“Develop Software Applications Up to 6 Times Faster or Your Money Back.”

“7 Questions to Ask Before You Hire a Collection Agency ... and One Good Answer to Each.”  
36. Stress the value of your premiums.  
“Yours Free—Order Now and Receive $280 in Free Gifts with Your Paid Subscription.”  
37. Help the reader achieve a goal.  
“Now You Can Create a Breakthrough Marketing Plan Within the Next 30 Days ... for FREE!”  
38. Make a seemingly contradictory statement or promise.  
“Cool Any Room in Your House Fast—Without Air Conditioning!”  
Notice that many of these headline use numbers. Numbers attract the reader’s eye. They should always be  
written as numerals. If you say “7 reasons why,” prospects want to know the seven reasons and will read the  
ad to learn them. Also ads and content written as lists, or “listicles,” which look more like editorial content, are
You can use the How to
##  the 4U's formula

 
- Urgent: Make $100,000 working from home this year”  
has a greater sense of urgency than “Make $100,000 working from home.” Once  
the offer period is over, the offer is no longer available.
- Unique:   
The powerful headline either says something new or, if it says something the reader has heard  before, says it in a new and fresh way. For example, “Why Japanese women have beautiful skin” was the headline in an e-mail promoting a Japanese bath kit. This is different from the typical “Save 10% on Japanese  
Bath Kits.”
- Ultra-specific: Examples: “What never to eat on an airplane,” “Bills it’s okay to pay late, and “Best time to file for a tax refund.”
- Useful: The strong subject line appeals to the reader’s self-interest by offering a benefit. In the headline “An Invitation to Ski & Save,” the benefit is saving money.

=> Check how much does your headline does in all of those parts on a scale to 1 to 4. You gotta reach at least 9/16, with 3 or more on all of them. If they are, then the headline is clickbait. 

## Example of a title that sucks balls
A marketer wrote to tell me he had sent out a successful e-mail marketing campaign with **the subject line  “Free Special Report.**” How does this stack up against the 4 U’s? 

• Urgent. There is no urgency or sense of timeliness. On a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the highest rating,  “Free Special Report” is a 1.  
• Unique. Not every marketer offers a free special report, but a lot of them do. So “Free Special Report”  rates only a 2 in terms of uniqueness.  
• Ultra-specific. Could the marketer have been less specific than “Free Special Report”? Yes, he could have just said “Free Bonus Gift.” So we rate “Free Special Report” a 2 instead of a • Useful. I suppose the reader is smart enough to figure that the report contains some helpful information.  On the other hand, the usefulness is in the specific information contained in the report, which isn’t even hinted  at in the headline. And does the recipient, who already has too much to read, really need yet another “free  
special report”? I rate it a 2. Specifying the topic would help (e.g., “Free special report reveals how to cut  training costs up to 90% with e-learning”).




## Struggle producing a Headline? Follow those steps:
1. Who is my customer?  
2. What are the important features of the product?  
3. Which of these features do competing products lack?   **(USP)**
4. Why will the customer want to buy the product? (What product feature delivers the benefit most  important to him?)

Ok. I answer tat shit. Then what? Well, fucker, then you: 
1. write 6 to 8 headlines
 Nothing good?

2. ORGANISE YOUR SELLING POINTS
Pincus, a freelance copywriter, developed a unique organizational pattern for the sales letters he writes. Pincus begins with a headline that conveys a promise, shows how the promise is fulfilled, and gives proof that the product is everything the copy says it is. Then he tells the reader how to order the product and  
explains why the cost of the product is insignificant compared to its value.  
Before you create an ad or landing page, write down your sales points. Organize them in a logical, persuasive, clear fashion. And present them in this order when you write your copy.

Here are 4 simple writing principles that can do more than any other writing techniques to make your copy clear  
and easy to read:  
Short words.  
Short sentences.  
Short paragraphs.  
Short sections.  

# Model Headlines for references
38 MODEL HEADLINES FOR YOUR “SWIPE FILE”  
A “swipe file” is a collection of promotions that you turn to for reference when creating your own marketing  
materials. The best way to get ideas for headlines when you are stuck is to keep a swipe file and consult it for  
inspiration when you sit down to write a new ad or mailing.  
The best swipe samples are those that keep running. You know they are being repeated—because they are  
profitable. Put a red X on any swipe samples you see multiple times, so you can identify winners at a glance.

## Organize your selling points
When you write your copy, you must carefully organize the points you want to make. In an ad, you might  
have one primary sales message (“This car gets good mileage”) and several secondary messages (“roomy  
interior,” “low price,” “$500 rebate”).  
The headline states the main selling proposition, and the first few paragraphs expand on it. Secondary  
points are covered later in the body copy. If this copy is lengthy, each secondary point may get a separate
The organization of your selling points depends on their relative importance, the amount of information you  
give the reader, and the type of copy you are writing (letter, ad, commercial, blog post, or news story).  
Terry C. Smith, a former communications manager with Westinghouse, has a rule for organizing sales points  
in speeches and presentations. His rule is: “Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Tell them. And then, tell  
them what you told them.” The speechwriter first gives an overview of the presentation, covers the important  
points in sequence, and then gives a brief summary of these points. Listeners, unlike readers, cannot refer to a  
printed page to remind them of what was said, and these overviews and summaries help your audience learn  
and remember.  
Burton Pincus, a freelance copywriter, developed a unique organizational pattern for the sales letters he  
writes. Pincus begins with a headline that conveys a promise, shows how the promise is fulfilled, and gives  
proof that the product is everything the copy says it is. Then he tells the reader how to order the product and  
explains why the cost of the product is insignificant compared to its value.  
Before you create an ad or landing page, write down your sales points. Organize them in a logical,  
persuasive, clear fashion. And present them in this order when you write your copy.  

### FRAMEWORK FOR CREATING A COPY
THE MOTIVATING SEQUENCE  
Over the years, many advertising writers have developed “copy formulas” for structuring ads, commercials,  
and sales letters.  
The best known of these formulas is AIDA, which stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.  
According to AIDA, the copy must first get the reader’s attention, then create an interest in the product, then  
turn that interest into a strong desire to own the product, and finally ask the reader to buy the product or take  
some other action that will eventually lead to a sale.  
A second well-known formula is ACCA: Awareness, Comprehension, Conviction, Action. In ACCA, consumers  
are first made aware that the product exists. Then they must comprehend what the product is and what it will  
do for them. After comprehension, the readers must be convinced to buy the product. And finally, they must  
take action and actually make the purchase.  
A third famous formula is the 4 P’s: Picture, Promise, Prove, Push. The copywriter creates a picture of what  
the product can do for the reader, promises the picture will come true if the reader buys the product, proves  
what the product has done for others, and pushes for immediate action.  
A fourth and my personal favorite is the “motivating sequence,” a five-step formula for writing copy that  
sells.  
1. Get Attention  
This is the job of the headline and the visual. The headline should focus on the single strongest benefit you can  
offer the reader.  
Some copywriters try to hook the reader with clever phrases, puns, or irrelevant information, then save the  
strongest benefit for a big windup finish. A mistake. If you don’t hook the reader with the strongest benefit—  
the most important reason why he or she should be interested in what you’re selling—the reader won’t get past  
the headline. (For more tips on headline writing, see chapter 2.)  
2. Show a Need  
All products, to some degree, solve some problem or fill a need. A car solves the problem of getting to and  
from work. An air conditioner prevents you from sweltering in summer heat. Toothpaste with fluoride keeps  
your teeth from getting holes in them. And mouthwash saves you the embarrassment of having bad breath.  
However, with most products, the need for the product may not be obvious or it may not be ingrained in the  
reader’s mind. The second step of writing copy that sells, then, is to show the reader why she needs the  
product.  
For example, many small-business owners do their own taxes and haven’t thought about hiring an  
accountant. But an accountant, with his or her superior knowledge of taxes, can take advantage of the latest  
tax regulations and save the business owner hundreds or even thousands of dollars in income tax.  
So one tax reduction firm’s TV commercial promises: if you owe the IRS $10,000 or more, we can help you  
settle the unpaid taxes you owe for pennies on the dollar.  
3. Satisfy the Need and Position Your Product as a Solution to the Problem  
Once you’ve convinced readers that they have a need, you must quickly show them that your product can  
satisfy this need, answer their questions, or solve their problems.  
An ad for a CPA firm might begin like this:  
WOULD YOU PAY $1,000 TO SAVE $5,500?  
Last year, a local flower shop decided to hire an accountant to do their income tax returns. They worried about the  
seemingly high fee, but realized they didn’t have the time—or the expertise—to do it themselves.  
You can imagine how delighted they were when they hired an accountant who showed them how they could pay  
thousands of dollars less in income tax than they originally thought they would owe.  
I am their accountant, and I’d like to tell you how the flower shop—and dozens of other firms whose taxes I prepare—have saved $2,000 ... $3,500 ... even $5,500 a year or more by taking advantage of legitimate tax  
regulations, deductions, and shelters.  
This copy isn’t perfect. It needs some work. But it does get attention, highlights a major benefit (saving  
money), and shows that the service being advertised can satisfy the need.  
4. Prove Your Product Can Do What You Say It Can Do  
It isn’t enough to say you can satisfy readers’ needs—you’ve got to prove you can. You want the readers to risk  
their hard-earned money on your product or service. You want them to buy from or hire you instead of your  
competitors. How do you demonstrate your superiority over the competition? How do you get the readers to  
believe what you say?  
Here are a few proven techniques for convincing the readers that it’s to their advantage to do business with  
you:  
• Talk about the benefits of your product or service (use the features/benefits list as the source of your  
discussion). Give the readers reasons to buy by showing the benefits they’ll get when they own your product.  
• Use testimonials. In testimonials, others who have bought the product praise the product in their own  
words. This third-party endorsement is much more convincing than manufacturers praising their own product.  
• Compare your product to the competition’s. Show, benefit for benefit, how you are superior. But have  
documentation supporting your claim in case your copy is challenged.  
• If you have conducted studies to prove your product’s superiority, cite this evidence in the copy. Offer a  
free reprint of the study to interested readers. For dietary supplements, the proof is clinical studies—preferably  
randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials—published in peer-reviewed medical journals.  
• Show that your company is reliable and will be in business a long time. Talk about number of employees,  
size of distributor network, annual sales, number of years in business, growth rate.  
5. Ask for Action  
The last step in any piece of copy should always be a call for action. If the product is sold by mail, ask readers  
to mail in an order form, or go online to buy. If the product is sold retail, ask readers to clip the ad and bring it  
into the store.  
If your ad doesn’t sell the product directly, then find out the next step in the buying process and tell your  
readers about it. For example, you might offer a free brochure on the product, a demonstration, or a sample. At  
the very least, encourage the readers to look for the product in the future if they are not going to buy it today.  
Make it easy for the readers to take action. Include your company name, address, and phone number in  
every piece of copy you write.  
If you’re writing retail copy, include store hours and locations.  
If you’re writing copy for a hotel or tourist attraction, include easy-to-follow instructions on how to get there,  
along with a clearly drawn map of the area.  
If you want the readers to send in an order or write for a free brochure, include a handy coupon they can clip  
and mail.  
If you want the readers to call, highlight your toll-free number in large boldface type. And, if you take credit-  
card orders, be sure to say so and indicate which cards you accept.  
Put order forms in catalogs, reply cards in mailers, dealer lists in industrial sales literature, and response  
forms at the top of landing pages. Make it easy for your readers to respond.  
Offer a Web response option, where the ad hyperlinks to an online form the prospects can use to request  
more information or place an order.  
And, if possible, give the readers an incentive for responding now: a price-off coupon, a time-limited sale, a  
discount to the first one thousand people who order the product. Don’t be afraid to try for immediate action  
and sales as well as long-range “image building.” Ask for the order, and ask for it right away.  


## FOLLOW THE SIMPLE 4 S FORMULA  
Here are 4 simple writing principles that can do more than any other writing techniques to make your copy clear  
and easy to read:  
Short words.  
Short sentences.  
Short paragraphs.  
Short sections.  
### Use Short Sentences  
Short sentences are easier to read than long sentences. All professional writers—newspaper reporters,  
publicists, magazine writers, copywriters—are taught to write in crisp, short, snappy sentences.  
Long sentences tire and puzzle your readers. By the time they have gotten to the end of a lengthy sentence,  
they don’t remember what was at the beginning.  
D. H. Menzel, coauthor of Writing a Technical Paper, conducted a survey to find the best length for sentences  
in technical papers. He found that sentences became difficult to understand beyond a length of about 34  
words. And the consumer has far less patience with wordiness and run-on sentences than does the scientist  
studying an important report.  
Rudolf Flesch, best known for his classic books Why Johnny Can’t Read and The Art of Plain Talk , said the  
best average sentence length for business writing is 14 to 16 words. Twenty to 25 words is passable, he added,  
but above 40 words, the writing becomes unreadable.  
Because ad writers place a premium on clarity, their sentences are even shorter than Flesch’s  
recommended: 14- to 16-word average.  
Now, let’s take a look at how you can reduce sentence length. First, you should break large sentences into  
two or more separate sentences whenever possible.

wants your pumps to work for all they’re worth.

and 49 years.  
Another method of breaking up a long sentence is to use punctuation to divide it into two parts.
## Use Bullets  
One of the most effective techniques for writing copy is to present the content as a list of bulleted items (e.g.,  
“7 ways to reduce your heating bill this winter”). Many copywriters rattle off the bullets quickly—and as a result  
settle for bullets that are ordinary and therefore not engaging.  
It takes a bit more energy and creativity to come up with a bullet item that is as strong and compelling as  
this classic from Boardroom: “What Never to Eat on an Airplane.”  
One of the most common mistakes with bullets is not including the right level of information. “Tell too much,  
and you give away the information free, and there is no need to order the product to find the answer,” says  
copywriter Parris Lampropoulos. “For example, if your bullet says ‘how to erase pain by using an over-the-  
counter lotion called capsaicin,’ no curiosity is generated because you’ve already told the secret.”  
On the other hand, says Parris, if your bullet contains too little information, or not enough specific  
information, it fails to grab attention. “If you say ‘why B vitamins are an absolute must for people predisposed  
to this disease,’ you fail to hook me, because I don’t know what ‘this disease’ is,” says Parris.  
His rule of thumb for writing strong bullets: Be specific about the problem; be vague and mysterious about  
the solution. Plus, do it with a twist, hook, or unusual angle.  
Parris gives as an example a copywriter who had to write a promotion for a book on natural health. One of  
the tips in the book was that sitting on bulky objects can cause back pain. So if you have a big, bulging wallet,  
take it out of your back pocket and keep it in your front pocket to prevent back stress. The bullet that the  
copywriter came up with: “How a pickpocket can make your back pain better.” He is specific about the problem  
(back pain), but mysterious about the solution (how can a pickpocket help with back pain?).
How to create Brochurees
# CONTENT MARKETING
What to do if the niche is unsaturated? 
1. Find an unsaturated niche.  
2. Consistently produce a volume of quality, helpful material aimed at a relevant audience (or persona).  
3. Never stop producing content.  
Dominating a niche early has extremely important long-term value because the search engines will  
continue to recognize and reward the authority your website accrues for a long time. One pioneering blogger  
told me that after dominating his niche with content for so long, he could probably remain at the top of most  
search engines for years ... even if he never wrote another blog post again.  
The Content Saturation Index  
Marcus Sheridan, an entrepreneur and content marketing thought leader, created a theoretical term to  
describe this condition -- “content saturation index.”1 While his social media drug of choice is blogging, his  
experience relates to any content form. He described in a post:  
“The more content an industry/niche has written about it, the harder it is for a blog to make headway  
and find success in that field. And when an industry has very little online content available to the  
masses, it can often be gobbled up within almost no time at all.

## what makes  a great content
I wrote a post about social media audits and published it on my blog. It received no comments or  social activity AT ALL. I later submitted the exact same piece to the Social Media Today website. It  was tweeted hundreds of times and I also had some great responses across the blogosphere.  
So much for great content. It’s the exact same article, but since my blog doesn’t have authority or  community, it wouldn't have been found or read regardless of the quality of my work.  I think at this point the focus has to move from content creation toward the idea of building  community, developing strategies to distribute the content, and marketing to promote every piece.”  
Marcela hit on some more suspicions that point to the elusive Content Code: Regardless of quality, content  marketing success must also include community, distribution, and promotion.  

**The Mirabeau miracle**  
Consider one more example that points to the secrets to content marketing success in an information dense world.  
A few years ago, I was approached by a friendly fellow named Stephen Cronk for help on a new marketing  
strategy. Here’s a summary of his story:  
He left his corporate job in London and moved his family to the Provence region of France.  
In the teeth of a recession and with no previous wine-making experience, he started a new winery called  
Mirabeau.  
He had 600 established competitors—and that was just in Provence!  
This was a tough assignment, but I do love a challenge, and most important, I believed in Stephen. He  
possessed an excellent business mind, an urgency to learn, and a great sense of storytelling. I had to say  
yes!  
Our first step was to determine where he could maneuver in a highly saturated, low-growth market. We  
couldn’t afford to be a “me too.” We conducted a complete market and competitive analysis and discovered  
that among the hundreds of wineries in his region, none of them had a meaningful digital marketing  
presence. At the same time, his potential retail customers were trying to gain a foothold in the social media  
space. In this intersection, we found our opportunity.  
We had to scale a content marketing effort quickly and decided that Stephen’s primary source would be  
video. He was a natural on camera, and the lush and ancient countryside of Provence provided an ideal  
backdrop to explore wine making, food, history, art, and the local color.  
Stephen consistently documented his wine-making journey in a very human and entertaining way. He  
talked about a labeling crisis that almost crushed his business. He created entertaining videos about the  
ridiculous paperwork he faced from the French government, what it was like to attend an international wine-  
tasting competition, and how the grapes were harvested in the early morning sunlight. He created stories  
about his village, his pets, and his family. He shared his anguish as he knelt beside grape vines decimated by  
a 13-minute hail storm. He captured the pure joy of his children dancing while on a family vacation.  
He was putting a human and modern face to a stodgy, traditional business.  
In addition to producing content, we also had a network strategy and continuously worked on building a  
wine-loving audience that was passionate about his product and the stories from his little family business. As  
his audience and engagement multiplied, Stephen was able to share this data with huge wine retailers to  
prove a point of differentiation. No winemaker in the region had the presence and audience that the upstart  
Mirabeau had. The strategy worked, and the orders started coming in.  
Stephen followed our strategy to dominate this unsaturated content niche and his progress was steady.  
But on his 222nd video, Stephen found the gold at the end of the rainbow. In just 29 seconds, he  
demonstrated how to open a wine bottle with only his shoe.6 That video has now attracted well over 9 million  
views ... one of the greatest small business video success stories in the history of the web!  
The viral attention gave a significant lift to all the content on the site. Because Stephen had worked so  
long and hard to provide entertaining videos, the viral visitors stuck around to see what else he had for them.  
Since the “shoe video,” the winery’s “About Mirabeau” video on its YouTube channel has received more than  
10,000 new views. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and newsletter subscriptions have had massive  
gains.  
The tiny winery received immense media attention from both the mainstream press and wine industry  
bloggers who marveled at Stephen’s authentic and human storytelling:
