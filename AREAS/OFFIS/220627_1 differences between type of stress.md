# Differences between type of stress

^33bce7

### [[Sandoval-Reyes et al. - 2019 - Relationship Amongst Technology Use, Work Overload.pdf]]
“These new demands require that people increase their efforts to achieve the demanding performance objectives that correspond to the business models of a globalized world [3]. #technostress 
>technostress is related to workload. The increase is work task, the novelty of technology in this every changing work affect the efforts workers has to do to keep up, which affects stress

 
What are the factors leading to technostress #unnecessary 
“Connection to work thanks to developments in information and communication technologies implicitly implies an extension of the work day [8]. This can lead workers to an unwanted state that can be called “always in work mode” [9] and that assumes ever-increasing workloads” (Sandoval-Reyes et al., 2019, p. 2) #stressfactors 
>Not being able to disconnect from work is also a factor of stress

Work overload definition: 
Work overload can come from the desire to make more money or to be recognize. 
>[8] mediated in turn by a desire for incentives, security status and the ability to be promoted [10,11].

It is a psychological condition seen as a stressor by workers. This condition can lead to diseases. Eventhough, some studies show people satisfy by their job experience workoeverload. 
> “Some studies find that work overload is a characteristic of job satisfaction, despite leading to unhealthy patterns  Nonetheless, extensive literature shows that work overload is negatively related to health indicators [12,13]. 


![[Pasted image 20220626093915.png]]
One reason why workers experience work overload is the availability of technology #technostress : Their phones, bringing work on the table etc...
>Despite its benefits, the intensive use of information and communication technologies as management tools, dilutes the boundaries between physical spaces and work responsibilities. 

 
 

A difference between technostress mental load and workload may be that: The use of  technologies causes an increase in the workload of the workers that impede their ability to detach from work and increase their stress
> Consistent with the mediation model undergoing empirical testing, the results indicate a positive relationship between the use of technology and perceived overload. 
### [[Brivio et al. - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog.

Here are some of the **causes of technostress**:
- Techo-anxiety: Sometimes people are uncertain on the steps when using a technology and are scared of ruining something (in a power grid for ex.)
- Techno-addiction: Just like  Sandoval (2019) it relates to inability of disconnecting from work and using technology to send messages, check updates, etc...
- Techno-strain^1: Having to learn new technologies every time can cause stress to workers.

Many others factors also play a role in generating technostress: 
	discomfort and fatigue resulting from multitasking, as ICTs allow for completion of more tasks in a lesser amount of time (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008); frequent interruption of assigned tasks due to the ongoing stream of communication (Mark et al., 2008). These stressors, together with a lack of personal coping mechanisms, create technostress in the work environment, placing both physiological and psychological consequences on employees.


It's interesting to notice that the psychological effects of technostress and increase workload confound each other
- fatigue, insomnia
- perceived increased level of mental load and time pressure
- reduction in job satisfaction and commitment


### [[Harris and Li - 2020 - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics. M.pdf]] 
 *This study is very interesting because it adresses the correlation between mental workload and technostress and somehow, how to measure them*

### DEFINITIONS
**Mental workload** and stress relate to each other, but its hard to find a single definition of mental workload. It can be seen as a percieved tension during the excution of a task.
	 “The very first impression drawn from the extensive review of the literature was the considerable difficulty in finding a consensus in the definition of “mental workload”. Cain [7] reports that there is no commonly accepted formal definition of this concept. This author points out that it can be characterized as a mental construction that reflects the “mental tension” resulting from the execution of a task under specific environmental and operational conditions, associated with the operator’s ability to respond to these demands.” #workload 
>“It is a concept very close to that of fatigue, stress, anxiety and performance.” 
“To this day, technostress has become a serious problem for IT users and other professionals due to its potential negative effect on users’ mental capacity [59]. This concept has raised interest among the scholars, as it also falls under the notion that everything, including technology, has a dark side [48].” #technostress 

A **definition of technostress** may be the incapacity to adapt to a technology in a healty manner. It can be due to the intrinsic difficulty of the task or the beliefs of the user. Therefore, people feel a certain amount of stress in direct or indirect contact with technologies.
>[...] the inability of the individual to adapt to a type of technology in a healthy manner, and that can manifest itself in the event of the difficulty in accepting computer technologies and in the event of excessive identification with these technologies. 



##### Technostress is created by:
- [ Techno-overload](Ragu-Nathan, T.S., et al.: The consequences of technostress for end users in organizations: conceptual development and empirical validation. Inf. Syst. Res. 19(4), 417–433 (2008). https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1070.0165): #workload  increase
- Techno-complexity: Inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies
- Techno-insecurity [[#Brivio et al - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog]]
- Technological uncertainty: Not being able to control how a technology constantly changes.
The consequences of technostress once again are the same as seen in [[Brivio et al. - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog.pdf]]


##### CORRELATION WITH  MENTAL LOAD
1. They correlated because of the inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies [44]
2. Because use of technology creates a lot of information to process in a short period of time [28]
3. The information about the technology may not be suitable for the abilities of the worker: [Distributed cognition into socio technical systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10111-013-0256-9)


### CLT #cognitiveloadtheory
There's a theory that helps seperate causes of mental overlaod: the CLT (Cognitive Load Theory). According to it, mental workload comes from: 
- Intrinsic: The intrisic difficulty of the task
- Extraneous: depends on how the task is presented (See the difference between a pop-science video on a funny maths concept or a hardcore scientific article with 60 lines of equtions )
- Germane: Mental energy and processes needed to encode information in LTMemory *(see more under)*
	“In the context of learning, this theoretical model is aimed at supporting instructors in the development of novel instructional designs aligned with the limitations of the human cognitive architecture [43] and points out to three types of cognitive load: the intrinsic load or the level of difficulty in completing the task, the extraneous load or how the task is presented in the learning environment, and the germane load or the integration of information to long-term memory from the formulation of mental schemes” #workload #workloadfactors 
In this case, a poor design of a technology, say in a power grid, can contribute to an increase in stress of the user. 

As mentioned by Orru and Longo [43], the CLT goal is to reduce the extraneous load that represents an ineffective amount of load in the instructional design. The notion of capacity is related to the mental energy that will remain for the student to create more schemas. In other words, the energy available to invest the information from working memory into long term memory.
>Cognitive Load Theory assume that there's a load created by technology on cognitive ressources, and most of it isn't necessary (Extraneaous and Germane laod), By reengineering the instructional design we can free up ressource, dimish #workload  and even #technostress 
>


Workload can be accurately measure by physiological factors because workload express itself by tension, efforts, both generating change in our: vigilance, that is measure by pupil density, muscle tension, eye movement or even heart reath. 
>Finally, since the mental workload is strongly related to the concepts of tension and effort, physiological measures are based on the premise that both variables generate internal changes, such as the increase in the level of activation or vigilance [22].
