**I assume you wanted to make an external link instead of an internal one. That is done  with \[text](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49044-7)  instead of  \[\[]](without the backslashes). The way you did it, it doesnt open the url in the browser, but tries to open a note with the title https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49044-7 . Usually, it should paste the url in the correct format if you just use ctrl+v. What is the meaning of this link, anyway? If you took quotes out of it, I prefer to have it as a header as you did below. **
# Differences between type of stress
**If the first header is the same as the note title, you dont need to include it =)**
### [[Sandoval-Reyes et al. - 2019 - Relationship Amongst Technology Use, Work Overload.pdf]]
- **Make this the first header with one #**
- **If you include a link to a pdf or an image, please upload the files, too. I put all my pics in the folder misc/media. That is just a suggestion, though, but it cant hurt to have them in the same place**
- **In general, I prefer to have citations with the citations plugin instead of the link to the pdf. That is because I have all my references in the references.bib file, so I can export them quickly to latex. I usually only link to pdfs if  I worked through the pdf in obsidian and have highlights or comments in the pdf itself. Lange Rede, kurer Sinn: make this  [[Sandoval-Reyes, Acosta-Prado, Sanchís-Pedregosa (2019)]] , instead, please =)**
- **(BTW, in case you didnt know, there is [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org/) and [arxiv2bibtex](https://arxiv2bibtex.org/). If you just input the doi or the arxive number in there, it gives you the complete bibtex reference that you can just copy to your .bib file =) )**

“These new demands require that people increase their efforts to achieve the demanding performance objectives that correspond to the business models of a globalized world [3]. #technostress  **As I said, no need to retype the tags over and over again. If you have #technostress in the beginning of the document, that is enough. If you have information about something else that warrants the use of a tag in the note, it is usally better to put that in a separate note and link to it, if necessary**
>technostress is related to workload. The increase is work task, the novelty of technology in this every changing work affect the efforts workers has to do to keep up, which affects stress

**I assume the blockquote is the summary of the direkt quote in your own words? In that case, I prefer it in this format:**
"Direct Quote" (can be blockquote if it is overly long, like several lines)
-> (or =>) own words
**Also, I am unsure how you got that interpretation of the sentence that you quoted? I would want to have another, better fitting source for that claim. I am going to omit it from my example note, just in case.**
//Ene's answer: I deleted several parts of the quote, completely forgotting that this context was need to interpret my message! I'll remember that. 

#technostress [...] #unnecessary **what is the unnecessary tag for?**
> people should increase their emotional effort, as well as levels of mental and psychological activation, which can lead to the depletion of resources and affect the process of recovery from work demands [4,5]. It is required that the physical and psychological state of the person remain optimal, ensuring adequate levels of energy, motivation and commitment [6,7].” (Sandoval-Reyes et al., 2019, p. 2) **unnecessary to quote the paper here again if it already is in the title**

What are the factors leading to technostress #unnecessary 
“Connection to work thanks to developments in information and communication technologies implicitly implies an extension of the work day [8]. This can lead workers to an unwanted state that can be called “always in work mode” [9] and that assumes ever-increasing workloads” (Sandoval-Reyes et al., 2019, p. 2) #stressfactors 
>Not being able to disconnect from work is also a factor of stress


Work overload definition:  **I made definition work overload a level-2-header, then I created another note for the definition and transcluded it under the header, see my example. You can do transclusion with \!\[\[]] (without backslashes)**
**I took the following out because the original sentence is so badly written that even I cant make sense of it :D **

Work overload can come from the desire to make more money or to be recognize. 
>[8] mediated in turn by a desire for incentives, security status and the ability to be promoted [10,11].


It is a psychological condition seen as a stressor by workers. This condition can lead to diseases. Eventhough, some studies show people satisfy by their job experience workoeverload.  **Formatting and grammar errors in this sentence**
> “Some studies find that work overload is a characteristic of job satisfaction, despite leading to unhealthy patterns  Nonetheless, extensive literature shows that work overload is negatively related to health indicators [12,13]. 

People that are overload often experience "low psychological detachement", and just can't plug out from work. There's a 3 way relationship between W-Overload, P. detachement and technology use.
>Hence, work overload manifests itself as a stressor that may have an impact on the levels of recovery from long working hours and, as a result, low psychological detachment. 
![[Pasted image 20220626093915.png]]
**Image is missing**
One reason why workers experience work overload is the availability of technology #technostress : Their phones, bringing work on the table etc...
>Despite its benefits, the intensive use of information and communication technologies as management tools, dilutes the boundaries between physical spaces and work responsibilities. 
**I cut everything up till here because I am not interested in the consequences of workload or why they experience it**
Other caracteristics of workoverload is being ultra-connected to the work
**You are missing part of the sentences; also, I adapted the quote a bit to make it shorter and included the indirect quote with a  proper citation; see my example**
>“askvan and Kubicek [1] indicate that work overload is characterized by the need to work faster, the need for quicker responses, reduced break periods and the need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In general, work overload and the extension of working hours is a reality in many occup” 


A good way of diminishing workoverload due to technology use, that have an actual model, is the  stressor-detachment model by Sonnentag and Fritz (See the photo UP)
**which photo?^^ but I am not interested in diminishing work overload, anyway, so it might not be important, anyway**

A difference between technostress mental load and workload may be that: The use of  technologies causes an increase in the workload of the workers that impede their ability to detach from work and increase their stress **umformuliert**
> Consistent with the mediation model undergoing empirical testing, the results indicate a positive relationship between the use of technology and perceived overload. 
### [[Brivio et al. - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog.
**made this a level-2-header just as above**

Here are some of the **causes of technostress**:
- Techo-anxiety: Sometimes people are uncertain on the steps when using a technology and are scared of ruining something (in a power grid for ex.)
- Techno-addiction: Just like  Sandoval (2019) it relates to inability of disconnecting from work and using technology to send messages, check updates, etc...
- Techno-strain^1: Having to learn new technologies every time can cause stress to workers.

Many others factors also play a role in generating technostress: 
	discomfort and fatigue resulting from multitasking, as ICTs allow for completion of more tasks in a lesser amount of time (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008); frequent interruption of assigned tasks due to the ongoing stream of communication (Mark et al., 2008). These stressors, together with a lack of personal coping mechanisms, create technostress in the work environment, placing both physiological and psychological consequences on employees.


It's interesting to notice that the psychological effects of technostress and increase workload confound each other
- fatigue, insomnia
- perceived increased level of mental load and time pressure
- reduction in job satisfaction and commitment


### [[Harris and Li - 2020 - Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics. M.pdf]] 
 *This study is very interesting because it adresses the correlation between mental workload and technostress and somehow, how to measure them*

### DEFINITIONS
**Mental workload** and stress relate to each other, but its hard to find a single definition ofmental workload. It can be seen as a percieved tension during the excution of a task.
	 “The very first impression drawn from the extensive review of the literature was the considerable difficulty in finding a consensus in the definition of “mental workload”. Cain [7] reports that there is no commonly accepted formal definition of this concept. This author points out that it can be characterized as a mental construction that reflects the “mental tension” resulting from the execution of a task under specific environmental and operational conditions, associated with the operator’s ability to respond to these demands.” #workload 
>“It is a concept very close to that of fatigue, stress, anxiety and performance.” 
“To this day, technostress has become a serious problem for IT users and other professionals due to its potential negative effect on users’ mental capacity [59]. This concept has raised interest among the scholars, as it also falls under the notion that everything, including technology, has a dark side [48].” #technostress 

A **definition of technostress** may be the incapacity to addapt to a technology in a healty manner. It can be due to the intrinsic difficulty of the task or the beliefs of the user. Therefore, people feel a certain amount of stress in direct or indirect contact with technologies.
>[...] the inability of the individual to adapt to a type of technology in a healthy manner, and that can manifest itself in the event of the difficulty in accepting computer technologies and in the event of excessive identification with these technologies.

- Techno-complexity: Inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies
- Techno-insecurity [[#Brivio et al - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog]]
- Technological uncertainty: Not being able to control how a technology constantly changes.
The consequences of technostress once again are the same as seen in [[Brivio et al. - 2018 - Preventing Technostress Through Positive Technolog.pdf]]


##### CORRELATION WITH  MENTAL LOAD
1. They correlated because of the inability to learn or manage the complexity of new technologies [44]
2. Because use of technology creates a lot of information to process in a short period of time [28]
3. The information about the technology may not be suitable for the abilities of the worker: [Distributed cognition into socio technical systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10111-013-0256-9)


### CLT #cognitiveloadtheory
There's a theory that helps seperate causes of mental overlaod: the CLT (Cognitive Load Theory). According to it, mental workload comes from: 
- Intrinsic: The intrisic difficulty of the task
- Extraneous: depends on how the task is presented (See the difference between a pop-science video on a funny maths concept or a hardcore scientific article with 60 lines of equtions )
- Germane: Mental energy and processes needed to encode information in LTMemory *(see more under)*
	“In the context of learning, this theoretical model is aimed at supporting instructors in the development of novel instructional designs aligned with the limitations of the human cognitive architecture [43] and points out to three types of cognitive load: the intrinsic load or the level of difficulty in completing the task, the extraneous load or how the task is presented in the learning environment, and the germane load or the integration of information to long-term memory from the formulation of mental schemes” #workload #workloadfactors 
In this case, a poor design of a technology, say in a power grid, can contribute to an increase in stress of the user. 

As mentioned by Orru and Longo [43], the CLT goal is to reduce the extraneous load that represents an ineffective amount of load in the instructional design. The notion of capacity is related to the mental energy that will remain for the student to create more schemas. In other words, the energy available to invest the information from working memory into long term memory.
>Cognitive Load Theory assume that there's a load created by technology on cognitive ressources, and most of it isn't necessary (Extraneaous and Germane laod), By reengineering the instructional design we can free up ressource, dimish #workload  and even #technostress 
>


Workload can be accurately measure by physiological factors because workload express itself by tension, efforts, both generating change in our: vigilance, that is measure by pupil density, muscle tension, eye movement or even heart reath. 
>Finally, since the mental workload is strongly related to the concepts of tension and effort, physiological measures are based on the premise that both variables generate internal changes, such as the increase in the level of activation or vigilance [22]. 
> #measure #measurestress #workload  



#### Task-technology fit model (TTF)
This model explains the performance of a worker, depending on how the technology used matches its abilities *(more inside*)
	 is a theoretical model that focuses on the prediction of performance, encompassing the analysis of matching aspects of a determined technology with the characteristics of a determined task expected to be performed by this type of technology. More specifically, TTF is the correspondence between task requirements, individual abilities and the functionality and features of technology #measure #stressmodel #stressfactors #technostress 
 Different factors affects the adjustment of the task with the used technology (like using a new coding language etc...) 
 
	 ![[Pasted image 20220626101455.png]]
	 an[ even more detailed model on that is called the technology to performance chain model” (TPC)](Goodhue, D.L., Thompson, R.L.: Task-technology fit and individual performance. MIS Q. **19**(2), 213 (1995). [https://doi.org/10.2307/249689](https://doi.org/10.2307/249689))
 in what manner the mental workload generated by the use of technology can be a mediating or risk effect of technostress.
 Mental workload is clearly distinct from technostress, yet the two concepts are strongly linked in scientific literature. Both can be measured using the same methods (via physiological, subjective and behavioral techniques). Intuitively, technostress causes can affect the mental workload of employees in the use of digital technologies within the workplace. #measurestress #workloadvstechnostress #workload #technostress 
	As previously discussed, the appropriation of technologies is not a cause of the variables of technostress or mental workload. However, as observed in the scientific research, both variables can condition the misappropriation or non-use of technology in the context of work. It is crucial to outline is that the appropriation of technology fosters a holistic view of the use of technology, focusing on how people use the technology, why they use it and which institutional factors (norms, values or requirements) within context will influence this use. The following graph attempts to summarize the ideas mentioned above (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49044-7_2#Fig1)).![[497428_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.webp]
	


## [[Alsuraykh et al. - 2019 - How Stress and Mental Workload are Connected.pdf]]
“In our research, we have seen both people that enjoy high workload, and people that feel stressed by it, but we do not know whether that experience of stress significantly affects our measurements. Our recent results show that fNIRS measurements are affected by stress (measured by SSSQ).” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1) The SSSQ can segregate stress during high mental workload, but used fNIRS
> NO

“Some have pointed out that an increase in Heart Rate is linked with high mental workload [9] [52] while others show that increase in Heart Rate is also triggered by stress [10] [15] [46], and surprise [40], or indeed just physical movement.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1)
>NO

“has focused on fNIRS as movement-tolerant brain sensor for use in HCI experiments [27] [33] [37] [44]. For example, it has been used to evaluate the UX of software [34] and used to adapt tasks [1] [56]. While using fNIRS to measure Mental Workload during Air Traffic Control (ATC)” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1)
>NO


“The relationship between MWL and stress is much more complicated than: high workload is bad, and indeed that: experienced stress is bad. As there is a lack of clarity in how stress and MWL are related, because they are used to describe often similar phenomena, this paper reviews literature to clarify the relationship between these two concepts, and elaborate on why they are hard to study separately.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 1) #workload 

“MWL has been described as “the relationship between primary task performance and the resources demanded by the primary task” [52]. In other words, MWL is the relationship between demands placed upon individuals and their capacity to cope with it.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) You're getting a high task like coding. How well do you cope with it. Are you "overwehlmed" or do you feel confident etc... handling that.

“Many measures for assessing mental workload have been developed and they are classified into three types: performance-based assessment, subjective workload assessment, and physiological workload assessment [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) What are the 3 criteria that aremeasured to asses MWL and how do they connect  to overall stress?
>NO workload measurement



“In order to gain better understanding of the measurement process of MWL, the following MWL framework by [52] might be useful. It comprises three main parts: 1) the physical and cognitive task demands, 2) the operator’s workload and 3) the performance (See Figure 1).” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)
> NO


“hysical and cognitive task demands are a reflection of a task’s features that are imposed on a person. It is necessary to determine the work demands that individuals might face in order to measure Mental Workload. In addition, because the demand could be perceived differently by different individuals, it is essential to measure both the imposed demands and perceived demand.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)
>NO


“Operator workload can be defined as “equivalent to measures of operator strain or effort” [40]. Several MWL measurements focus only on measuring the operator experience during and after the task using different subjective questionnaires, however, it has used the measures of effort from behaviour indices and the impact of effort physiology” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) Do operator workload actually correlates with stress?
>NO


“According to [28], they indicated that the meaning of the term “stress” has no precise consensus. It has been defined the “Stress” as the lack of balancing between environmental demands and individual capabilities [30]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2) defintion of stress again #stress “in other words, stress could indicate to the coping with the external or internal adverse conditions (stressors), which is the behavioural, psychological and physiological responses [12].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)
“However, some researchers have defined the term of stress as non-equivalent degree between demands made upon a person and his/her ability of coping with those certain demands.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 2)
“Commission Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs (2003) described it as a “state characterized by high levels of arousal and distress and often feelings of not copin” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)
“From this point of view, it has been revealed that the psychological stress is the consequence of individuals’ appraisals of their environment as exacting or exceeding their resources and/or hazard their safety [30” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) better definition of stress

“0]. The estimates of demanding or threatening surrounding environments are multifaceted, reflecting emotional (affect), motivational (conation), and cognitive processes. However, across nearly all of these dimensions, the notion of ‘too much workload’ recurs” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)
>NO


“In addition, it has been suggested that one definition of stress is that ‘the demands of an event exceed personal resources and is motivated by the emotional response to harm and threat’ and, in short, is ‘the relationship between the person and the environment’ [30]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) #stress




“HR [7” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“1) primary appraisal which includes the location of a event, such as stressful, and 2) a secondary appraisal appears after an evaluation of the event, such as threat or challenge.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“There is similarity between the Transactional Theory of Stress by [14] and the Framework for MWL by [51]. In MWL framework, the operator workload is influenced by the way that task is perceived by the operator, while there is association between demand and performance. It has been pointed out that the outcome demand created by a combination of physical and cognitive task demands and external and internal influences [42]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3) Looks like stress depends on how the operator defines it. NOt necessarily if its WM is overwehlmed. It's like an embebbed cognitive apraisal related to the incapacity of handling the demands or maintaining performance #stress

“Therefore, if an individual has high capacity to respond to an increased demand, he/she will be less likely to experience a stress response and indeed any stress response could be both” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 3)

“psychological and physiological. When we consider these models together then, it appears to be the case that stress and MWL are strongly interconnected.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)



“Various studies have attempted to measure the stress and MWL, which can be divided into three categories: (1) Self-reporting and subjective ratings using standard questionnaires such as the NASATLX [21] and the SSSQ [22]) ; (2) Behavioral measures, such as primary and secondary-task performance; and (3) physiological measurements, such as including Heart Rate, Skin Temperature to monitor task demand (MW) [8] [20] [50] as well as stress level [9] [14], pupillometry, electromyography, galvanic skin response, and brain activity [51] [53].” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Several experiments have been examined the stress and MWL. For example, it has been found that there are significant correlation stress and mental workload (positive correlation) which means when the subjects have higher mental workload and more negative emotion, they tend to experience more stress [55]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“it has been revealed that there is tight link between mental workload and psychological stress during flight task, where there found a significant positive correlation between HR and mental workload/psychological stress [11” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“ough a large number of experiments have showed that MIST was worked efficiently and effectively in terms of inducing stress level, our studies revealed that MIST increased experienced mental workload as well as stres” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Indeed, its mechanism relies heavily on increasing time pressure in task demand, and this thus manipulating what one would expect to increase mental workload.” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4)

“Similar to performance, the lack of copying with the perceived demand and perceived capability will impact the cognitive appraisal, which in turn will induce the stress response, that could be psychological and/or physiological [13]” (Alsuraykh et al., 2019, p. 4) How stress measurements influence WML that alsoinfluences stress
