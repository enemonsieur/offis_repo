In a power grid, peIn this study, we model the effect of stress during a stroop task . We assess physiological stress of  participants: pupil's eyes dimension, Heart Rate variability (HRV) and  Frontal Alpha Assymetry (FAA). and psychological stress via a NASA-TLX questionnaire.

In a power grid, workers are subject to a high amount of stress during their task. Being able quickly assess stress level is critical to guarantee their saftey.
In this study, we investigate the effects of different factors during a stress inducing task (a program used in power grids) to accurately predict the level of stress of the participants. A number of participants will be recruted and subject to a task to increase stress level. The subjects will be subject to two conditions: One with external stress factors: Loud noise, red color and flashes. The other without external stress factors. Levels of stress will be measured by the Hemodynamical brain activity using fNIRS. 
The induction of mental stress was confirmed by a NASA TLX stress questionnaire

Using fNIRS features, we are trying to predict mental stress of power grid workers

In a power grid, workers are subject to high amount of stress. The goal of our study is to accurately model and predict their stress level during task. We recruit a number of participant and submit them to two conditions to increase stress level. In the first condition, they have a high mental load task without external stress factors. In the second, they have the same task with external stress factors (loud noise). Change in hemodynamical activity is measure with fNIRS to assess their stress level. The induction of mental stress was confirmed by a NASA TLX stress questionnaire.

In a power grid, workers are subject to high amount of stress. The goal of our study is to model their stress level. We recruit a number of participants and submit them to two conditions: In the first condition they are working on a fault management with low stress and mental load. In the second they are working on a balance group management with medium mental load and stress. Change in hemodynamical activity is  measured with fNIRS to assess their stress level. The induction of mental stress will be assess by a NASA TLX stress questionnaire.
If we can indeed produce stress and high mental workload, the next step will be to use our model to train a reinforcement learning agent to attack the powergrid.
