In a power grid, peIn this study, we model the effect of stress during a stroop task . We assess physiological stress of  participants: pupil's eyes dimension, Heart Rate variability (HRV) and  Frontal Alpha Assymetry (FAA). and psychological stress via a NASA-TLX questionnaire.

In a power grid, workers are subject to a high amount of stress during their task. Being able quickly assess stress level is critical to guarantee their saftey.
In this study, we investigate the effects of different factors during a stress inducing task (stroop task) to accurately predict the level of stress of the participants. A number of participants will be recruted and subject to a task to increase stress level. The subjects will be subject to two conditions: One with external stress factors: Loud noise, red color and flashes. The other without external stress factors. Levels of stress will be measured by the Hemodynamical brain activity using fNIRS. 

The induction of mental stress was confirmed by salivary alpha amylase test.
