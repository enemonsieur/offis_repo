# Workload, Techno Overload, and Behavioral Stress During COVID-19 Emergency: The Role of Job Crafting in Remote Workers
Â **[@sjbsf]** According to the JD-R Model, the balance between demands and resources, and their effects on well-being at work are described by considering the individual and organizational outcomes (which can be either positive or negative) ([Bakker and Demerouti, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148/full#B5)). The JD-R paradigm defines two classes of working conditions: job demands and job resources. Job resources are all those physical, psychological, social, or organizational characteristics of the work that are functional to achieving goals and to reduce the psychological costs associated with job requests (examples of job resources are: work autonomy, feedback relating to performance, social support, supervision, coaching, and time control). On the other hand, job demands are all the requests forcing individuals to put greater effort and energy into their tasks in order to achieve goals and satisfy needs but which can also create opportunities for personal growth and development ([Van den Broeck et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148/full#B64)). Examples of job demands are workload, time pressure, emotionally and cognitively challenging interactions with others, high responsibility, new projects, and challenging demands. When job demands are high, they can be considered threatening or challenging for people at work.


Besides workload, over the last years, a new demand related to the use of technology is emerging in several organizational contexts: this is generally referred to as techno overload. In fact, technology in organizations can be both a positive instrument to better manage the working processes and work-life balance and a challenge because when demanding and stressful it can negatively impact workers' health ([Sandoval-Reyes et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148/full#B52)).

Nevertheless, the acceptance of changes requires time and effort by employees; some workers gladly accept new challenges, others, instead, get affected by them. Therefore, the rapid technological changes have caused new problems to individuals in their workplace and lifestyle ([Ghislieri et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148/full#B20)).

Techno overload, considered a techno-stressor, is associated with stressful situations that contribute to work longer and faster than normal. It can lead to handling a huge amount of information, provoking fatigue, memory difficulties, and loss of control for the workers.

Two relevant stressors have been correlated with the use of ICTs in professional environments: information overload and constant availability. The first stressor occurs when a worker receives a lot of information from different sources, and this can cause excessive strain. The second is about the individuals' constant availability to be connected to their work through the use of ICTs (e.g., mobile phone or PC). Due to their open attitude, they tend to work longer than usual because ICTs create expectations for faster response ([Garbarino and Costa, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148/full#B17)), contributing to work overload. Thus, moving from this theoretical background, the study investigated the health impairment process during the COVID-19 lockdown considering the relationship between work overload (a job demand consisting of workload and techno overload) and behavioral stress. Specifically, the first hypothesis was formulated as follows:

_H_1_: work overload will be positively connected with behavioral stress_.
