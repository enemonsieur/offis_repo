## HIGH-INTENSITY RUNS  
Speed Play  
Run Use perceived effort (1–2) to establish Zone 1 intensity in the warm-up.  
Use heart rate to stay in Zone 1 through completion of the warm-up.  
Use perceived effort (3–4) to make the initial adjustment to Zone 2 after the warm-up.  
Use heart rate to stay in Zone 2 throughout the Zone 2 segment of the run.  
Use perceived effort to make the initial adjustment to either Zone 4 or Zone 5 for each speed play segment. Choose an initial RPE of 7 for Zone 4  
speed play segments and 9 for Zone 5 speed-play segments.  
Use RPE to maintain Zone 4 or Zone 5 intensity throughout each speed play segment. RPE may climb from 7 to 8 in Zone 4 speed play segments,  
but as a general rule it should not reach 8 until you’re at least halfway through the workout. Likewise, RPE may climb from 9 to 10 in Zone 5 speed  
play segments, but as a general rule, it should not reach 10 until you’re at least halfway through the workout.  
Use perceived effort (3–4) to make the initial adjustment to Zone 2 after each speed play segment.  
Use heart rate to stay in Zone 2 throughout each recovery period between speed play segments.  
Use perceived effort (1–2) to make the initial adjustment to Zone 1 for the cool-down.  
Use heart rate to stay in Zone 1 throughout cool-down.
