	 What  job would you hire your personnal assiant for?

#code **Collect** only and always note things that resonnate with you in a deeper level. it doesnt matter if its usefull today or later. Just write it, or copy it, or highlight it.

**Organize** the best way to organize content is only with stuff  you care about now. Jote them all in the current task you're working  like your language course or grey matters newsletter and tag them approprietly
**Distill:** as Sönhe Akrens said the best way to distill is to always summarize the notes so that you won't have to walk through them again. You'll really just have to read few comprehensible note and don't go back into rereading. Actually. IT works for school, work, and personnal project. Having to reread stuffs just to understand what they mean is a waste of time. 
**Express**: As always, knowledge is best remember when we use it. Don't waste time hoarding notes if you're not gonna create something. Samething with school or whatever. Always learn the way you're going to publish. Always learn with the purpose  of creating. => Intermediate packages
#notetaking an error I've always make is not organizing the most importnat. For example my matlab. Had I organize  all my matlab file,s I'd be easily able to go trough usefull bit of coedes and snatch them back. Its extremely essential to have them well noted, and tags, and even basically organized so I can come back to them fast and learn them.
Also I should have moved all of the MATLAB files out of my repository, and add the PSTH in the ressources. For future intermediate packages.

how do I know if I should #notetaking 
Does it inspire me? Gut feeling.
Is there a step by step process inside that I know I'd like to have so that I wont have to think in the futre?
Is there a reference, a diagram that'd make my life easier? For example to invest money - guide of brokey, invest in NFTs


#para Use the Para method to store notes:
- Projects
- Areas (what are the things you are doing without ends?)
- Resources
- Archives

- Always try to put your notes in the most actionnable steps. **Am besten, all your notes must finish into a project you're currently working on.** 

Don't organize notes based on where they come from: Dont put theses current notes in your  "book fucking folder" just because It came from book. Organize them based on how currently usefull they are: Management notes, fMRI notes, neuroscience for content notes, neurosciences in general notes (ressources)
=> Re-read that shit. 

**- Quantum note taking** : Take notes that will survive the quantum jump into the future. If the insights arrive messed up and hard to find, understand, or even remember, youre future self will never give a fuck. 

# Progressive Summarization
1. Highlights 3-5% of every book
2. Take notes of the important 10-20% of them
3. Summarize the 10-20% of your notes in important points and actionable steps
![[Pasted image 20220709133821.png]]
It's based on the fact that only the most important ideas stick. But you don't have the mental energy to turn them into a good speech  for your future self, so focus on those 10-20% ideas 
-Tiago Forte. The best stuff always stick to your mind and hour or two (or a day or two)
- Test: CAN YOU GET THE GIST OF IT at a glance?
- Progressive summarization: Instead of agressively try to note every part of a book, try to capture links for article or explanations or audios from professor. Put them in the appropriate folder. 
	- Then later, find your usual links you see. Highlight the most important passages, NEVER more than 10 % of the whole stuff. And add them in a common storage. You may want to include stuff that resonate with you but you can't explain why. 
	- Then comment 20% max of those highlights in a way that'd be easy to contextualize and that your future sefl will immediately grasp

How do I make my notes more discoverable? How do I convince my futur self that does note s are worth rereading? May be by having a summary of the most important points. And the action steps. 


# Intermediate Packets
The IP are content that can be digest by a certain public, give you feedback, but don't count as a final project:
- Distilled notes: From past articles, books that you summarized
- Michael Simmons Twitter Thread, Tiktok videos resumating a focused ideas
- Past works of course, like my mini-course, my articles, it'd be super, when starting a project like publishing again on neursociences to reassamble the past projects into a PROJECT dedicated to that. 
## Resurface Past work
## How to expert your work
Use the sharing of article to friends/people asking/twitter/sharing, to resume the work into distilled notes before saving, then add them in the appropriate PARA. Friends will hlep you increase your knowledge, and you'll help them actually read and learn that shit.
