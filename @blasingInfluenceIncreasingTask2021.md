For all model based analyses, parameter calculations were performed over the total assembly time of each participant and model. To derivate an estimation of MWL, overand underload reference values over the whole assembly time were determined (mean and standard deviation). For each model, the total percentage of time HR, and PR one SD over or under the mean was calculated. For HR analysis, a continuous calculation approach was chosen (calculating HR over the last 20 heart beats with a 75% temporal overlap).
