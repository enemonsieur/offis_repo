      "abstractNote": "According to the self-determination theory, individuals' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness should be satisfied for optimal psychological growth. The satisfaction of these needs seems to vary due to changes in a person's social context, and the outcomes of the satisfaction of these needs also vary along with the needs. Despite several studies investigating daily and weekly variations in need satisfaction and its correlates, no systematic investigation exists. This study aimed to conduct a narrative synthesis of existing quantitative diary studies of basic psychological needs in the work context. We specifically aimed to evaluate if psychological need satisfaction varies daily and weekly and judge whether they vary more daily or weekly. Additionally, we also aimed to review the literature regarding the relations between daily or weekly variations in need satisfaction and its assumed antecedents and outcomes. We included peer-reviewed articles in English that measured work-related basic psychological needs using a quantitative diary study design. Database searching (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost, and Scopus) led to the extraction of 2 251 records by February 2020. Duplicates were removed, the remaining records were screened (\n              n\n              = 820), and 30 articles were assessed using eligibility criteria. Two authors individually conducted the screening and eligibility processes to manage selection bias. In total, 21 articles were included in the final review. The review indicated that basic psychological need satisfaction showed considerable within-person variation and was more dynamic daily (compared to weekly). Job demands, job resources, organisational resources, and individual characteristics appeared to associate with these variations. The organisational context seemed to matter the most for need satisfaction. Variations in need satisfaction were also related to employee well-being, performance, and motivation. Despite the small number of published studies (particularly for weekly studies), our results indicate that researchers should pay attention to within-person variations in need satisfaction. Measuring daily need satisfaction could be prioritised. Different antecedents and outcomes seem to be associated with different needs. Thus, when needs are viewed as distinct constructs instead of unidimensional ones, one can derive greater insights. The study is funded by the National Research Foundation.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\nWe investigate the effect of conditions that create technostress, on technology-enabled innovation, technology-enabled performance and overall performance. We further look at the role of technology self-efficacy, organizational mechanisms that inhibit technostress and technology competence as possible mitigations to the effects of technostress creators. Our findings show a negative association between technostress creators and performance. We find that, while traditional effort-based mechanisms such as building technology competence reduce the impact of technostress creators on technology-enabled innovation and performance, more empowering mechanisms such as developing technology self-efficacy and information systems (IS) literacy enhancement and involvement in IS initiatives are required to counter the decrease in overall performance because of technostress creators. Noting that the professional sales context offers increasingly high expectations for technology-enabled performance in an inherently interpersonal-oriented and relationship-oriented environment with regard to overall performance, and high failure rates for IS acceptance/use, the study uses survey data collected from 237 institutional sales professionals.",

      "abstractNote": "High workload of nurses in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has been identiﬁed as a major patient safety and worker stress problem. However, relatively little attention has been dedicated to the measurement of workload in healthcare. The objectives of this study are to describe and examine several methods to measure workload of ICU nurses. We then focus on the measurement of ICU nurses’ workload using a subjective rating instrument: the NASA TLX. We conducted secondary data analysis on data from two, multi-site, cross-sectional questionnaire studies to examine several instruments to measure ICU nurses’ workload. The combined database contains the data from 757 ICU nurses in eight hospitals and 21 ICUs. Results show that the different methods to measure workload of ICU nurses, such as patient-based and operator-based workload, are only moderately correlated, or not correlated at all. Results show further that among the operator-based instruments, the NASA TLX is the most reliable and valid questionnaire to measure workload and that NASA TLX can be used in a healthcare setting. Managers of hospitals and ICUs can beneﬁt from the results of this research as it provides benchmark data on workload experienced by nurses in a variety of ICUs.",

      "abstractNote": "Individuals performing cognitive tasks experience a range of subjective states including stress, excitement, and fatigue. This article reviews research based on a multidimensional assessment of state dimensions in the performance context, the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ). Various types of evidence for validity support diﬀerentiating task engagement, distress, and worry dimensions as indices of the dynamic transaction between the performer and the task environment. The article aims to illustrate diﬀerent uses of the scale in theory-based and applied studies of individual diﬀerences in performance. One usage is investigating relationships between personality traits, resilience, and stress reactivity. Subjective states reﬂect cognitive stress processes (appraisal and coping), which may be biased by traits. A second usage is testing theories of stress eﬀects on attention and performance; research ﬁndings link task engagement to resources for sustained and focused attention, and distress to impairments in working memory and executive control. A third usage is testing states as mediators of personality-performance associations. Individual diﬀerences in human performance may reﬂect biological, cognitive, and self-regulative processes, so that interpretation of subjective state scores requires an explicit theoretical orientation. Practical applications of the multidimensional model include support for stress mitigation, training, personnel selection and team performance.",

      "abstractNote": "Conscious appraisals of stress, or stress states, are an important aspect of human performance. This article presents evidence supporting the validity and measurement characteristics of a short multidimensional self-report measure of stress state, the Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ; Helton, 2004 ). The SSSQ measures task engagement, distress, and worry. A confirmatory factor analysis of the SSSQ using data pooled from multiple samples suggests the SSSQ does have a three factor structure and post-task changes are not due to changes in factor structure, but to mean level changes (state changes). In addition, the SSSQ demonstrates sensitivity to task stressors in line with hypotheses. Different task conditions elicited unique patterns of stress state on the three factors of the SSSQ in line with prior predictions. The 24-item SSSQ is a valid measure of stress state which may be useful to researchers interested in conscious appraisals of task-related stress.",

To reduce mental workload (MWL), informational assistance systems are introduced. The influence of complexity and used assistance system on MWL should be investigated to further improve the implementation of such assistance systems. (2) Methods: Using a simulated close to real-life assembly task a 2 × 3 design was chosen, with two levels of assembly complexity (within subjects) and three different assistance systems (paper, Augmented Reality (AR)-glasses, tablet–between subjects). MWL was measured using either physiological response (electrocardiogram (ECG) and eye-tracking) or performance indicators. (3) Results: An influence of task complexity on MWL can be shown. Additionally, usability based differences between the used assistance systems become more evident with reference to the results of area of interest analysis. (4) Conclusions: Using a multi-modal measurement approach, it is possible to detect complexity-based differences in MWL. Additional research on validity and alignment is needed to further use these for (neuro-) ergonomic considerations and recommendations.",

Internal consistency reliability, factorial validity, and hypothesis validity of the PSS were well reported. However, the test-retest reliability and criterion validity were relatively rarely evaluated. In general, the psychometric properties of the 10-item PSS were found to be superior to those of the 14-item PSS, while those of the 4-item scale fared the worst. The psychometric properties of the PSS have been evaluated empirically mostly using populations of college students or workers.\nConclusion: Overall, the PSS is an easy-to-use questionnaire with established acceptable psychometric properties. However, future studies should evaluate these psychometric properties in greater depth, and validate the scale using diverse populations.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective: Healthcare institutions worldwide are moving to electronic health records (EHRs). These transitions are particularly numerous in the US where healthcare systems are purchasing and implementing commercial EHRs to fulﬁll federal requirements. Despite the central role of EHRs to workﬂow, the cognitive impact of these transitions on the workforce has not been widely studied. This study assesses the changes in cognitive workload among pediatric nurses during data entry and retrieval tasks during transition from a hybrid electronic and paper information system to a commercial EHR. Materials and methods: Baseline demographics and computer attitude and skills scores were obtained from 74 pediatric nurses in two wards. They also completed an established and validated instrument, the NASA-TLX, that is designed to measure cognitive workload; this instrument was used to evaluate cognitive workload of data entry and retrieval. The NASATLX was administered at baseline (pre-implementation), 1, 5 and 10 shifts and 4 months post-implementation of the new EHR.\nResults: Most nurse participants experienced signiﬁcant increases of cognitive workload at 1 and 5 shifts after “go-live”. These increases abated at differing rates predicted by participants’ computer attitudes scores (p = 0.01).\nConclusions: There is substantially increased cognitive workload for nurses during the early phases (1–5 shifts) of EHR transitions. Health systems should anticipate variability across workers adapting to “meaningful use” EHRs. “One-size-ﬁts-all” training strategies may not be suitable and longer periods of technical support may be necessary for some workers.",

      "abstractNote": "This review investigates the effects of psychological stress on the human body measured through biosignals. When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efﬁciency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on biosignal patterns caused during stress conditions and reliable practical guidelines towards more efﬁcient detection of stress.",

Objective stress assessment methods using noninvasive physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalograms (EEG) have therefore been proposed for effective stress management. In this study, a novel wearable device that can measure electrocardiograms (ECG) and EEG simultaneously was designed to enable continuous stress monitoring in daily life. The developed system is easily worn by hanging from both ears, is lightweight (i.e., 42.5 g), and exhibits an excellent noise performance of 0.12 μVrms. Significant time and frequency features of HRV and EEG were found in two different stressors, namely the Stroop color word and mental arithmetic tests, using 14 young subjects. Stressor situations were classified using various HRV and EEG feature selections and a support vector machine technique. The five-fold cross-validation results obtained when using both EEG and HRV features showed the best performance with an accuracy of 87.5%, which demonstrated the requirement for simultaneous HRV and EEG measurements.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent studies have addressed stress level classiﬁcation via electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning. These works typically use EEG-based features, like power spectral density (PSD), to develop stress classiﬁers. Nonetheless, these classiﬁers are usually limited to the discrimination of two (stress and no stress) or three (low, medium, and high) stress levels. In this study we propose an alternative for quantitative stress assessment based on EEG and regression algorithms. To this aim, we conducted a group of 23 participants (mean age 22.65 ± 5.48) over a stress-relax experience while monitoring their EEG. First, we stressed the participants via the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), and then we led them through a 360-degree virtual reality (VR) relaxation experience. Throughout the session, the participants reported their self-perceived stress level (SPSL) via surveys. Subsequently, we extracted spectral features from the EEG of the participants and we developed individual models based on regression algorithms to predict their SPSL. We evaluated stress regression performance in terms of the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) and the correlation coefﬁcient (R2). The results yielded from this evaluation (MSPE = 10.62 ± 2.12, R2 = 0.92 ± 0.02) suggest that our approach predicted the stress level of the participants with remarkable performance. These results may have a positive impact in diverse areas that could beneﬁt from stress level quantitative prediction. These areas include research ﬁelds like neuromarketing, and training of professionals such as surgeons, industrial workers, or ﬁreﬁghters, that often face stressful situations.",

      "abstractNote": "This study examined daily ﬂuctuations in marital behavior (anger and withdrawal) as a function of same-day job stressors, using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Forty-three couples provided daily diary reports of their workload and negative social interactions at work on 5 consecutive days. Within-subject analyses demonstrate that husbands and wives reported greater marital anger and withdrawal following negative social interactions at work, and wives reported greater marital anger and withdrawal following days of heavy workload. Mediation analyses provide support for the negative mood spillover hypothesis (e.g., workload no longer predicted wives’ marital anger when controlling for negative mood). Betweensubjects analyses suggest that spouses in high-conﬂict families may be especially vulnerable to the effects of job stressors on marital interaction.",

      "abstractNote": "Introduction: The working environment is one of the most important recourses of occupational stress. The importance of management of occupational stress is recognized, besides all by Occupational health and safety since it has been found to be related not only with loss of productivity and loss of working hours but with the arousal of diseases and occupational accidents.\nPurpose: The aim of this systematic review was the examination of the sources and consequences of occupational stress on nurses’ adequacy, productivity, efficiency. Material –method: A systematic review was made in “European Agency for Safety and Health at Work”, “National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)”, “Job Stress Network” web sites for various publications and abstracts around the exact theme and the “Occupational and Environmental Medicine Journal” using as key words «stress, occupational stress, and Nursing».\nResults: A number of aspects of working life have been linked to stress. Aspects of the work itself can be stressful, namely work overload and role-based factors such as lack of power, role ambiguity, and role conﬂict. Threats to career development and achievement, including threat of redundancy, being undervalued and unclear promotion prospects are stressful. Stress is associated with reduced efficiency, decreased capacity to perform, a lack of concern for the organisation and colleagues.\nConclusions: During last decade there has been increasing recognition of the stress experienced by hospital nursing staff . Although some stressful situations are specific to a particular type of hospital unit, nurses are subject to more general stress which arises from the physical, psychological, and social aspects of the work environment. High levels of stress result in staff burnout and turnover and adversely affect patient care. Interventions that are targeted at sources of occupational stress seem to be required in order to support nurses.",

      "abstractNote": "The radical changes deriving from the COVID-19 emergency have heavily upset some of the most familiar routines of daily work life. Abruptly, many workers have been forced to face the difficulties switching to remote working. Basing on the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources model, the purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of work-overload (workload and techno-overload), on behavioral stress, meant as an outcome linked to the health impairment process. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March-May 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling; to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (n = 2000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work-overload and behavioral stress was positive; moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources; these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work-overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Findings extended the current occupational health psychology literature, especially in the mainstream of the topic “work and COVID-19” in the Italian context. Moreover, the results can be useful for companies focused on the management of change and the building of a collaborative workplace at the individual and collective levels; implementing job crafting interventions, for instance, could enhance workers’ personal and organizational resources, useful to coping with the changes occurring in their professional life.",

      "abstractNote": "The radical changes deriving from the COVID-19 emergency have heavily upset some of the most familiar routines of daily work life. Abruptly, many workers have been forced to face the difficulties that come with switching to remote working. Basing on the theoretical framework proposed by the Job Demands-Resources model, the purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of work overload (workload and techno overload), on behavioral stress, meant as an outcome linked to the health impairment process. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March–May 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling; to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (\n              n\n              = 2,000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work overload and behavioral stress was positive; moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources; these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Accordingly, findings extended the current trends in occupational health psychology research, with special reference to the mainstream topic “work and COVID-19” in the Italian context. Finally, results can give suggestions to companies engaged in managing change, recommending that they build a collaborative workplace at the individual and collective level to implement job crafting interventions and enrich the personal and organizational resources of workers, which is useful cope with the current demands.",

      "abstractNote": "The research reported in this paper studies the phenomenon of technostress, that is, stress experienced by end users of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), and examines its influence on their job satisfaction, commitment to the organization, and intention to stay. Drawing from the Transaction-Based Model of stress and prior research on the effects of ICTs on end users, we first conceptually build a nomological net for technostress to understand the influence of technostress on three variables relating to end users of ICTs: job satisfaction, and organizational and continuance commitment. Because there are no prior instruments to measure constructs related to technostress, we develop and empirically validate two second order constructs: technostress creators (i.e., factors that create stress from the use of ICTs) and technostress inhibitors (i.e., organizational mechanisms that reduce stress from the use of ICTs). We test our conceptual model using data from the responses of 608 end users of ICTs from multiple organizations to a survey questionnaire. Our results, based on structural equation modeling (SEM), show that technostress creators decrease job satisfaction, leading to decreased organizational and continuance commitment, while Technostress inhibitors increase job satisfaction and organizational and continuance commitment. We also find that age, gender, education, and computer confidence influence technostress. The implications of these results and future research directions are discussed.",

The research objective of this research is to find out whether the level of technology competence and workload has an impact on employee performance through technostress as an intervening variable. The respondents of this study were 138 people whom work at Production and Engineering department of a multinational company using automation technology equipment in operation. A technique of data collection was done by using questionaire and interviews. Data was analysed using the SEM (Structural Equation Modelling) approach. From the research it can be concluded that the workload and competence level of automation technology had significant impact to technostress. Further, the study also shows a significant relationships between workload and employee performance which the Technostress acts as an intervening variable in the relationship.",

The present study addresses the relationship between technology and psychological detachment from work resulting from work overload. Participants were 313 professionals from the health sector who responded to three instruments used in similar studies. Through PLS-SEM, regression and dependence analyses were developed, and through the bootstrapping method, significance of factor loadings, path coefficients and variances were examined. Results of the study corroborate a negative effect of technology use on psychological detachment from work and a positive correlation between technology and work overload. Additionally, there is a significant indirect effect of technology on psychological detachment from work as a result of work overload. Findings extend the literature related to the stressor-detachment model, and support the idea that workers who are often connected to their jobs by technological tools are less likely to reach adequate psychological detachment levels. Implications for the academic community and practitioners are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Background and Objective: In recent years, stress and mental health have been considered as important worldwide concerns. Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the eﬃcacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of EMG signals for stress detection.\nMethods: Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory.\nResults: The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms.\nConclusions: The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.",

      "abstractNote": "Background and Objective: In recent years, stress and mental health have been considered as important worldwide concerns. Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the eﬃcacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of EMG signals for stress detection.\nMethods: Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory.\nResults: The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms.\nConclusions: The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.",

      "abstractNote": "Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) was proposed 20 years ago for study of task modulated connectivity on functional MRI (fMRI) data. A few modifications have since been made, but there remain misunderstandings on the method, as well as on its relations to a similar method named beta series correlation (BSC). Here, we explain what PPI measures and its relations to BSC. We first clarify that the interpretation of a regressor in a general linear model depends on not only itself but also on how other effects are modeled. In terms of PPI, it always reflects differences in connectivity between conditions, when the physiological variable is included as a covariate. Secondly, when there are multiple conditions, we explain how PPI models calculated from direct contrast between conditions could generate identical results as contrasting separate PPIs of each condition (a.k.a. “generalized” PPI). Thirdly, we explicit the deconvolution process that is used for PPI calculation, and how is it related to the trial-bytrial modeling for BSC, and illustrate the relations between PPI and those based upon BSC. In particular, when context sensitive changes in effective connectivity are present, they manifest as changes in correlations of observed trial-by-trial activations or functional connectivity. Therefore, BSC and PPI can detect similar connectivity differences. Lastly, we report empirical analyses using PPI and BSC on fMRI data of an event-related stop signal task to illustrate our points.",

      "abstractNote": "Conscious appraisals of stress, or stress states, are an important aspect of human performance. This article presents evidence supporting the validity and measurement characteristics of a short multidimensional self-report measure of stress state, the Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ; Helton, 2004 ). The SSSQ measures task engagement, distress, and worry. A confirmatory factor analysis of the SSSQ using data pooled from multiple samples suggests the SSSQ does have a three factor structure and post-task changes are not due to changes in factor structure, but to mean level changes (state changes). In addition, the SSSQ demonstrates sensitivity to task stressors in line with hypotheses. Different task conditions elicited unique patterns of stress state on the three factors of the SSSQ in line with prior predictions. The 24-item SSSQ is a valid measure of stress state which may be useful to researchers interested in conscious appraisals of task-related stress.",

To reduce mental workload (MWL), informational assistance systems are introduced. The influence of complexity and used assistance system on MWL should be investigated to further improve the implementation of such assistance systems. (2) Methods: Using a simulated close to real-life assembly task a 2 × 3 design was chosen, with two levels of assembly complexity (within subjects) and three different assistance systems (paper, Augmented Reality (AR)-glasses, tablet–between subjects). MWL was measured using either physiological response (electrocardiogram (ECG) and eye-tracking) or performance indicators. (3) Results: An influence of task complexity on MWL can be shown. Additionally, usability based differences between the used assistance systems become more evident with reference to the results of area of interest analysis. (4) Conclusions: Using a multi-modal measurement approach, it is possible to detect complexity-based differences in MWL. Additional research on validity and alignment is needed to further use these for (neuro-) ergonomic considerations and recommendations.",

      "abstractNote": "The radical changes deriving from the COVID-19 emergency have heavily upset some of the most familiar routines of daily work life. Abruptly, many workers have been forced to face the difficulties that come with switching to remote working. Basing on the theoretical framework proposed by the Job Demands-Resources model, the purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of work overload (workload and techno overload), on behavioral stress, meant as an outcome linked to the health impairment process. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March–May 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling; to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (\n              n\n              = 2,000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work overload and behavioral stress was positive; moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources; these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Accordingly, findings extended the current trends in occupational health psychology research, with special reference to the mainstream topic “work and COVID-19” in the Italian context. Finally, results can give suggestions to companies engaged in managing change, recommending that they build a collaborative workplace at the individual and collective level to implement job crafting interventions and enrich the personal and organizational resources of workers, which is useful cope with the current demands.",

Psychological detachment refers to an individual's experience of being mentally away from work, to make a pause in thinking about work-related issues, thus to “switch off”. This study examines job stressors, job involvement, and recovery-related self-efficacy as predictors of psychological detachment in a sample of 148 school teachers. Psychological detachment was assessed by self-reports and by ratings provided by family members. Multiple regression analysis showed that workload, job involvement, and recovery-related self-efficacy were significant predictors of both self-rated and family-rated psychological detachment. The study findings suggest that with respect to practical implications it is crucial to manage workload and to increase recovery-related self-efficacy.",

However, as detailed previously, there are many technological challenges and biological unknowns that stand in the way of creating such a device.

      "abstractNote": "Stress is a general term applied to the pressures felt in life. Stress at work is almost inevitable in many jobs. It has become a major buzzword and a legitimate concern of the time. In the modern era, privatization of education sector has been accumulating at a very fast pace resulting in increased competition among them, resulting in increased load per faculty in terms of roles and responsibilities causing additional challenges other than just quality teaching thus hindering overall development and teaching quality. The present study attempts to highlight why now a days the faculty members of the private institutes and universities are facing high level of stress. Through a questionnaire and factor analysis, the derived results show that workplace environment, harmony at workplace, performance concerns and wellbeing, and benchmarks and compensation are major factors, whose imbalance can create stress for faculty members. Useful for various educational institutions, the paper can prove beneficial to management who can take up improvement measures based on the results of this paper to reduce employee dissatisfaction or observed deviations in behavior.",

Confirmatory factor analyses with a calibration and a cross-validation sample (total N 930) showed that four recovery experiences can be differentiated: psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery, and control (Study 2). Examination of the nomological net in a subsample of Study 2 (N 271) revealed moderate relations of the recovery experiences with measures of job stressors and psychological well-being; relations with coping and personality variables were generally low (Study 3). Potential applications for the future use of these short 4-item measures in longitudinal and diary research are discussed.",

Performing regular secondary tasks while driving is an additional activity that dissipates attention and adds to the drivers’ workload. Identi­ fying driver fatigue and workload based on gaze behavior is one way to ensure a safe driving experience. The purpose of this paper is to classify and predict driving perceived workload using a set of eye-tracking metrics (gaze fixation, duration, pointing, and pupil diameter). The ability of eye-tracking metrics to predict driving workload has been investigated. As a result, frustration, performance, and temporal load showed a correlation with gaze metrics. Gaze point, duration, fixation, and pupil diameter significantly influence driving workload. Relevance to industry: Results will supply the specialists in eye-tracking/sensor technologies and traffic safety with new knowledge to improve the design of the driving performance and safety monitoring systems and ef­ ficiency of the driving process.",

The respondents of this study were 138 people whom work at Production and Engineering department of a multinational company using automation technology equipment in operation. A technique of data collection was done by using questionaire and interviews. Data was analysed using the SEM (Structural Equation Modelling) approach. From the research it can be concluded that the workload and competence level of automation technology had significant impact to technostress. Further, the study also shows a significant relationships between workload and employee performance which the Technostress acts as an intervening variable in the relationship.",

In the first section the theoretical status of the concept of mental load is considered. It is concluded that it is based upon common sense, which cannot be supposed to be empirically founded in a simple way. Then an outline is given of the main procedures of measurement. The next section describes a number of theoretical bases which are all related to some kind of limited capacity notion. It is concluded that the original idea of channel capacity in terms of information theory fails to provide a sound theoretical framework. Other capacity concepts in terms of limited capacity processors and in terms of effort are described. Three types of processors are distinguished, which have different consequences for the measurement of mental load.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper introduces a method for resolving the problem of human stress detection through short-term (less than 5 min) electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) signals. The explored methodology helps to improve the stress detection rate and reliability through multiple evidences originated in same sensor. In this work, stress-inducing protocol, data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification are the major steps involved to detect the stress. In total, 60 subjects (30 males and 30 females) participated in the Stroop color word-based stress-inducing task and ECG signal was acquired simultaneously. The wavelet denoising algorithm was applied to remove high frequency, baseline wander and power line noises. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based heart rate (HR) detection algorithm is used for deriving HRV signal from the preprocessed ECG signal. The ectopic beat removal method is employed to eliminate the ectopic beat and noise peaks in the HRV signal. In order to detect the stress, the issue of uneven sampling with the HRV signal has been successfully rectified using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP). The application of LSP in short-term HRV signals (32 s), uneven sampling issue, and power spectral information issue has been rectified and the trustworthiness of the short-term HRV signal has been proved by hypothesis as well as experimental results. Theoretical analysis suggested that a minimum 25 s of online or offline ECG data is required to analyze the autonomous nervous system (ANS) activity related to stress. In addition to the HRV signal, ECG-based stress assessment has been proposed to detect the stress through optimum features using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Various features extracted from the ECG and HRV signal have been classified into normal and stress using PNN and kNN classifiers with different smoothing factor and k values. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology for short-term ECG and HRV signal can achieve the overall average classification accuracy of 91.66% and 94.66% in the subject-independent mode.",

This systematic review includes studies assessing stress exposures as work environment risk factors and stress outcomes, measured via self-perceived questionnaires and physiological stress detection. These measures needed to be assessed repeatedly or continuously via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) or similar methods carried out in real-world work environments, to be included in this review. The objective was to identify work environment risk factors causing day-to-day stress.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The search strategies were applied in seven databases resulting in 11833 records after deduplication, of which 41 studies were included in a qualitative synthesis. Associations were evaluated by correlational analyses.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The most commonly measured work environment risk factor was work intensity, while stress was most often framed as an affective response. Measures from these two dimensions were also most frequently correlated with each other and most of their correlation coefficients were statistically significant, making work intensity a major risk factor for day-to-day workplace stress.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review reveals a diversity in methodological approaches in data collection and data analysis. More studies combining self-perceived stress exposures and outcomes with physiological measures are warranted.",
