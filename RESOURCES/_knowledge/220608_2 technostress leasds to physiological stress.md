- "Riedl et al. [18]conducted an experiment in which participants were confronted with a simulated online merchant whose web site crashed during their interaction and measured its effect on usersâ€™ levels of **cortisol**. In a natural experiment, Mark et al. [12] had  volunteers take several days off from email and compared their **heart rate variability**.
