# What is stress? #stress
## in [[Cooper, Dewe, ODriscoll (2001)]]
- "wide discrepancies exist in the way that stress is defined and operationalized" ^930617
- the concept of stress has variously been defined as both an independent and a dependent variable (Cox, 1985) and as a “process"
	- -> "defined as a stimulus, a response, or the result of an interaction between the two, with the interaction described in terms of some imbalance between the person and the environment (Cox, 1978)"
## in [[Fink (2010)]]
- 'Stress is the non-specific response of the body to any demand' [[Selye (1956)]] #stress 
## in [[Kim, Diamond (2002)]]
Stress is made up of three components: #stress #stressfactors
- **Arousal**: ‘heightened excitability or arousal, which can be operationally measured using electroencephalography, behavioural (motor) activity or  neurochemical (adrenaline, glucocorticoid) levels’
-  **Aversion**: the experience must be perceived as uncomfortable or threatening
- **(Un)Controllability**: having control over an aversive experience has been shown to extremely mitigate how stressful a situation feels
# Types of stress
#stressfactors 
- good stress = eustress ^1714cb
- bad stress = distress (strain) ^85a6bc

## Technikstress/Technostress/Technology-induced Stress/High-Tech Stress
![[PDF Hoppe - Zuverlässige Stromversorgung durch Vermeidung von Technikstress#^e87hej1g7vr]](eigene Übersetzung)[^1]
- "any negative impact on attitudes, thought, behaviors, or body physiology that is caused either directly or indirectly by technology” (in [[Schellhammer, Haines, Klein (2013)]] aus [[Weil, Rosen (1997)]]) #technostress 
- a wide array of stressors that potentially result in increased strain on a worker:  increased workload [10], constant pressure to adapt to  new technologies [2], increased complexity of new  devices [2], technology breakdown [18], etc. ([[Schellhammer, Haines, Klein (2013)]]) #technostress 
- "stress caused by an inability to cope with the demands of organizational computer usage"  [[Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan (2010)]]
	- information overload and interruptions
- Core Factors (aus [[Coklar (2011)]]): #stressfactors #technostress 
	- Environmental Factors: Inappropriate working conditions or other environmental conditions, inappropriate lighting, insufficient equipment with security measures, equipment with compatibility issues, noisy equipment, incapable equipment, software limitations, lack of funding, electrical issues, risk of accidental data loss, insufficient maintenance knowledge, insufficient senior/adult personnel may cause people to suffer stress related with the use of technology
	- Societal Factors:  Conflicts of interest caused by the use of technology, power struggles, work and role changes, anxiety over loss of employment, work/employment fragmentation and hierarchal changes may cause people to suffer technology related stress. For example, an administrator who is decisive regarding the use of technology may press employees on their use of technology
	- -> passt nicht zu meinen Aufgaben!
- Six core factors (aus [[Enis (2005)]]:
	-  rapid change, **lack of education**, **increased workload**, **lack of standardization** in work, **reliability of technology**, and role alterations
- Six core factors (aus [[Harper (2000)]]):
	- **information overload**, under-working and routine jobs, job insecurity and  demotivation, and job uncertainty
- -> die fetten passen zu meinen Aufgaben!
- situational awareness? -> workload

- Zusammenhang Stress und Technikstress?
## Response-Based Model of Stress [[Cooper, Dewe, ODriscoll (2001)]]
- stress as a DV (a response to disturbing or threatening stimuli)
## Stimulus-Based Definitions of Stress
- Identification of potential sources of stress
- 

[^1]: a special form of stress, a specific or unspecific reaction pattern of the organism to external and interal stimulus events, that are caused directly or indirectly through technology, i.e. already through the design of technical tools, during the use of technical tools and through the general attitude and acceptance towards technical tools, and that disrupt the physical and psychological homeostasis as well as strain or exceed the ability to adapt or cope
