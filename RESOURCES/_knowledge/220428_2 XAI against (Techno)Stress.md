-  the higher the workload, the higher the technostress
- -> if we can decrease the workload by supporting the user, it seems reasonable to assume that we can also decrease the technostress
- # [[Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan (2010)]]
- "Mechanisms that facilitate involvement of users, and encourage them to take risks, learn, explore new ideas, and experiment in the context of ICT use, diminish the factors that create technostress and increase satisfaction with the ICT they use"
- -> XAI = involvement? Ergo weniger Technostress ergo bessere performance?
