# PIRE Seminar: Modeling Cognitive Workload while Driving - Moritz Held
- follow-up of anirudh's experiments
- measure & predict momentary workload
- visuospatial demands: manipulating road conditions (highway vs. construction)
- working memory load: n-back task
- ACT-R: cognitive theory about vision, motor movements, perception, memory ^1ebc4e
	- Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational
	- implemented as computer simulation
	- software where you can model cognitive models

- pupil size used as proxy for cognitive workload 
	- average pupil size increases of n-nack level (sign)
	- no difference between the two visuospatial conditions (highway vs construction)
