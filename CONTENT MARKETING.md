# CONTENT MARKETING
What to do if the niche is unsaturated? 
**1. Find an unsaturated niche.  
2. Consistently produce a volume of quality, helpful material aimed at a relevant audience (or persona).  
3. Never stop producing content.**  
Dominating a niche early has extremely important long-term value because the search engines will  
continue to recognize and reward the authority your website accrues for a long time. One pioneering blogger  
told me that after dominating his niche with content for so long, he could probably remain at the top of most  
search engines for years ... even if he never wrote another blog post again.  
**The Content Saturation Index**  
Marcus Sheridan, an entrepreneur and content marketing thought leader, created a theoretical term to  
describe this condition -- “content saturation index.”1 While his social media drug of choice is blogging, his  
experience relates to any content form. He described in a post:  
“The more content an industry/niche has written about it, the harder it is for a blog to make headway  
and find success in that field. And when an industry has very little online content available to the  
masses, it can often be gobbled up within almost no time at all.

## what makes  a great content
I wrote a post about social media audits and published it on my blog. It received no comments or  social activity AT ALL. I later submitted the exact same piece to the Social Media Today website. It  was tweeted hundreds of times and I also had some great responses across the blogosphere.  
So much for great content. It’s the exact same article, but since my blog doesn’t have authority or  community, it wouldn't have been found or read regardless of the quality of my work.  I think at this point the focus has to move from content creation toward the idea of building  community, developing strategies to distribute the content, and marketing to promote every piece.”  
Marcela hit on some more suspicions that point to the elusive Content Code: Regardless of quality, content  marketing success must also include community, distribution, and promotion.  

**The Mirabeau miracle**  
Consider one more example that points to the secrets to content marketing success in an information dense world.  
A few years ago, I was approached by a friendly fellow named Stephen Cronk for help on a new marketing  
strategy. Here’s a summary of his story:  
He left his corporate job in London and moved his family to the Provence region of France.  
In the teeth of a recession and with no previous wine-making experience, he started a new winery called  
Mirabeau.  
He had 600 established competitors—and that was just in Provence!  
This was a tough assignment, but I do love a challenge, and most important, I believed in Stephen. He  
possessed an excellent business mind, an urgency to learn, and a great sense of storytelling. I had to say  
yes!  
Our first step was to determine where he could maneuver in a highly saturated, low-growth market. We  
couldn’t afford to be a “me too.” We conducted a complete market and competitive analysis and discovered  
that among the hundreds of wineries in his region, none of them had a meaningful digital marketing  
presence. At the same time, his potential retail customers were trying to gain a foothold in the social media  
space. In this intersection, we found our opportunity.  
We had to scale a content marketing effort quickly and decided that Stephen’s primary source would be  
video. He was a natural on camera, and the lush and ancient countryside of Provence provided an ideal  
backdrop to explore wine making, food, history, art, and the local color.  
Stephen consistently documented his wine-making journey in a very human and entertaining way. He  
talked about a labeling crisis that almost crushed his business. He created entertaining videos about the  
ridiculous paperwork he faced from the French government, what it was like to attend an international wine-  
tasting competition, and how the grapes were harvested in the early morning sunlight. He created stories  
about his village, his pets, and his family. He shared his anguish as he knelt beside grape vines decimated by  
a 13-minute hail storm. He captured the pure joy of his children dancing while on a family vacation.  
He was putting a human and modern face to a stodgy, traditional business.  
In addition to producing content, we also had a network strategy and continuously worked on building a  
wine-loving audience that was passionate about his product and the stories from his little family business. As  
his audience and engagement multiplied, Stephen was able to share this data with huge wine retailers to  
prove a point of differentiation. No winemaker in the region had the presence and audience that the upstart  
Mirabeau had. The strategy worked, and the orders started coming in.  
Stephen followed our strategy to dominate this unsaturated content niche and his progress was steady.  
But on his 222nd video, Stephen found the gold at the end of the rainbow. In just 29 seconds, he  
demonstrated how to open a wine bottle with only his shoe.6 That video has now attracted well over 9 million  
views ... one of the greatest small business video success stories in the history of the web!  
The viral attention gave a significant lift to all the content on the site. Because Stephen had worked so  
long and hard to provide entertaining videos, the viral visitors stuck around to see what else he had for them.  
Since the “shoe video,” the winery’s “About Mirabeau” video on its YouTube channel has received more than  
10,000 new views. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and newsletter subscriptions have had massive  
gains.  
The tiny winery received immense media attention from both the mainstream press and wine industry  
bloggers who marveled at Stephen’s authentic and human storytelling:

##  Guidelines to find a un-saturated market
If there are fewer than 10,000 pages of returned search results, full speed ahead! There’s an opportunity  for you since there is low content density.
Between 10,000 and 100,000 results, expect some resistance, but it’s surmountable with minimal  
investment, exceptional content, and implementation of some of the Content Code factors covered in  
this book.  
If there are between 100,000 and 1 million search results, expect significant resistance. Competing  
through content alone will be difficult. Applying Content Code strategies might be the primary means of  
rising above this level of saturation.  
A result producing more than 1 million pages of content represents a thoroughly saturated niche. Unless  
the content becomes a product in its own right through significant investment, Content Shock exists in  
this niche and is likely to bury even exceptional content creation efforts. In this situation, the Content  
Code strategies would be the only possibility of strategic leverage.  
Examining the relative saturation in your niche is crucial to understanding how the Content Code formula  
will or will not work for your market. It’s extremely difficult to unseat somebody in the search engine ranking  
if they have dominated a niche, even if you’re doing great work. But it’s not hopeless.  
Of course the strategies in this book are going to work well in an environment where the content  
competition is still relatively low. If you’re fortunate enough to already own an unsaturated content niche,  
chances are you’ll dominate the search engine rankings too, and the Content Code will widen the gap  
between you and the laggards.  
However, if you’re behind in your market and you’re feeling like it’s “game over,” the Content Code can  
provide you with an ignition strategy and an entirely new opportunity to maneuver.  

## 3 types of content you need for your brand
2. Explore different types of content.  
YouTube first floated the idea 2 that different types of content, when combined together in an ideal mix, are  
extremely successful in building an engaged audience for the long-term. The three types of content are:  
### Hygiene content: Juices (Hilaire stuff)
This is the content that serves the daily health of your audience. This content makes  
them aware of your brand and helps them connect to you when they need you most. This is the specific,  
short-form content that is most likely to turn up in organic search results. An example of hygiene  
content is a series of how-to videos from a do-it-yourself store like Home Depot.  
### Hub content: Snacks (reuse, list, stories)
While hygiene content might get somebody to your site, hub content is intended to keep  
them there. This could be a series of articles about a more in-depth topic, or perhaps a serialized story,  
that makes people want to go down the rabbit hole and stay on your site. This could also be “evergreen”  
content that people seem to love and read month after month. An example of hub content is the  
addictive and thrilling adventure videos produced by Adidas Outdoor featuring daredevil athletes using  
their gear. Hub content lifts subscriptions to your content, spurs engagement, builds brand interest, and  
may even lead to brand loyalty.  
### Hero content: M. simmons
Hero content is something brilliant, dramatic, and bold that transcends the normal day-  
to-day Internet offerings. This is the content that creates viral buzz. A famous example is the epic videos  
Nike created to celebrate the World Cup. The most recent one, “Winner Stays,” playfully captures the  
schoolyard fantasy of young soccer players who morph into their favorite global stars. This type of  
content is difficult to produce. Nike was intentional in spending millions to create this hero content with  
the goal of creating massive brand awareness and dominating the conversation around the world’s  
biggest sporting event. The video received 100 million views.

## The six elements of the Content Code  
We’ve established that great content is rarely enough to assure success. Great content is simply the table  
stakes needed to earn a seat at the table. I’m not going to cover tips and tricks about writing for the web or  
creating epic videos. Those topics have already been effectively covered in many other places. We’re here to  
plow new ground.  
So here is the starting line for this race: You need great content.  
Let me repeat: You need great content. But then what?  
This is where the Content Code takes over. Content that rises and is discovered through search is a  
mixture of art, science, and magic that includes these six factors:  
Brand development  
Audience and Influencers  
Distribution, Advertising, Promotion, and SEO  
Authority  
“Shareability” embedded into each piece of content  
Social proof and social signals  
Now, if you’re paying close attention—and I’m sure you are—the first letter of each piece of the Content  
Code spells out BADASS.  
I consider this a giddy coincidence and perhaps the highlight of my professional career. I’m tempted to end  
the book right now as I’m sure there is nothing I can write that can ever top this. I bet you didn’t see that  
coming did you? You should send me a selfie right now with the look of surprise and amazement on your  
face. #BadassSelfie  
Okay, time to settle down. We must get back to the topic at hand, for this is a serious book for serious  
people. What does this BADASS thing really mean?  
Provided you start with great content (did I already mention that?), if you commit to continuously working  
on these six factors you’ll begin to crack the code. Although the six factors have been written about in bits  
and pieces by many talented experts (whom I call on to help tell the story), this is the first time the entire  
Content Code has been assembled in a cohesive way, in one book.  
In the chapters that follow, we will dive into each of these factors in detail, but the overall recipe for how  
you execute your plan is up to you. You see, there’s no simple strategy that fits everybody ...  
A business competing to sell discrete items in an eCommerce environment will want to emphasize brand  
building and search optimization.  
A lawyer, management consultant, or accountant will probably want to focus on establishing authority  
and a large, engaged audience consisting of consumers of their services.  
A company in a highly competitive international market may need to spend money on promotion and  
advertising to get their message through.  
An individual starting a blog might seek a true balance of all six factors but concentrate on writing highly  
shareable content and building a heroic personal brand that leads to fanatic supporters and business  
benefits.  
So the best way to use this book is to take a dive into all six pools and see what fits for your particular  
situation. You don’t necessarily need to work on all six factors to make progress. Pick out one or two that fit  
your business situation and capabilities, and you certainly will be better prepared for the future than your

# SHAREABILITY 
Here’s the mistake most companies make: They check the box on content and then forget about ignition. As I  
introduced in Chapter 1, content isn’t effective if it doesn’t move. People have to see it, engage with it, share  
it—or you’re wasting your money. By putting the emphasis on exposing your content instead of simply  
producing more, more, more, you create a powerful new marketing competency in the information era.  
This is where we’re going to spend our time for the rest of this book. You’ll become an expert on this  
complex cocktail of ideas and insights, promotion and production, audience and audacity ... that gets your  
content to explode through this wall of information density.  

**=> How to know if a content is worth sharing?**
THink about Ced/Madango sharing it:

It made you look cooler, smarter, funnier, or more relevant—providing you with a personal psychological  
benefit.  
The content struck some strong emotional chord. It made you laugh, cry, or otherwise feel something so  
profound it deserved to be shared with others.  
It’s practical or timely. Sharing the content will help and inform your friends.  
You found a new idea and can’t wait to be the first to share it.  
You feel deeply connected to the author and you want to support them.  
It represents an achievement. Maybe you or your company were mentioned in the content and it makes  
you feel good to show this representation of your status.

Research shows that people typically don’t share content they’re reading on the web, even “great”  
content.1 For example, a large study of social transmission across millions of Twitter accounts revealed that  
the majority of users are passive information consumers and rarely forward content to their network.  
In fact, an average Twitter user retweets only one in 318 content links they receive. Facebook reports that  
just one-half of one percent of those who see a Facebook post share it.2 These sobering numbers suggest  
that actively finding and nurturing that miniscule number of the most active users is critical to spreading your  
information on the web.

**Therefore, in order to become an effective content-igniter, you must not only create content and build an  audience but also employ strategies to overcome user passivity and systematically find individuals  
predisposed to love and share the content you’re creating. This is perhaps the most overlooked  
imperative in digital marketing today.**  


## 5 reasons to overcome disinteress and share content
To be useful. The number one reason people share content is to bring valuable and entertaining  
content to others. More than 90 percent of study participants said they carefully consider how the  
information they share will be useful to the recipient.  
To define ourselves to others. Nearly 70 percent of participants said they share content to give  
people a better sense of who they are and what they care about. One respondent said, “I try to share  
information that will reinforce the image I’d like to present—thoughtful, reasoned, kind, interested, and  
passionate about certain things.”  
To grow and nourish relationships. About 80 percent of participants share information online  
because it lets them stay connected to people they may not otherwise stay in touch with. A little over 70  
percent share content to help connect them to new people who share common interests.  
Self-fulfillment. About 70 percent of participants share content because it allows them to feel more  
involved in the world. The act of getting positive feedback on shares makes people feel valued.  
To get the word out about causes and brands. More than 80 percent of participants said they  
share content to rally others around a cause, company, or idea they believe in.

As you read this list, it probably occurs to you that sharing content is a meaningful act, a very personal,  
intimate, and important gesture. It’s not at all trivial.  
The decision to share content is often a sign of a relationship. A relationship with the source, a relationship  
with a network...even a relationship between the person and the content! Igniting content is a symbol of  kindness and caring and a reflection of who we are.  
Pretty deep stuff.  
One of my blog readers recently sent me this note:  
“Your blog has become part of my morning routine. I start my day with a cup of coffee and your latest  
blog post! I almost always share your posts with my friends because I feel like I know you. Your  
perspective aligns with my business values and I feel good about sharing your thoughts with others  
... and even with family members.”  
There is a lot of rich insight in this brief message:  
My content has connected to her on an emotional level, and I’ve become part of the fabric of her life.  
Although I’ve never met this person or even spoken to her on the phone, she feels as if she knows me as  
a friend. She has built a kinship with me through my content alone.  
Sharing my content is an act of adding value to her friends. It enhances her self-view because my values  
reflect her values. And the bond created through my words is so strong that she feels comfortable  
making me part of her family communications at times.  
I’ve built “shareability” into my content over time by nurturing a relationship of trust with the reader. I  
can’t appeal to everyone, of course—there are people who unsubscribe to my blog all the time. But for those  
who do connect, they seem to connect deeply.

**Sharing creates involved, smarter consumers**  
Sharing content isn’t just about building “traffic.” The act of sharing content actually helps consumers  
process your information better. A separate New York Times study4 on why and how people share content  
found that:  
73 percent of participants say they process information “more deeply, thoroughly, and thoughtfully”  
when they share it.  
85 percent say reading content that other people share helps them understand and process information  
and events.  
49 percent say sharing allows them to inform others of products they care about and potentially change  
opinions or encourage action.  
Participants say the act of sharing content helps them remember products and information sources better  
and makes them more likely to use them. So if you create ideal conditions for content-sharing, you both build  
power for your brand and create new economic value by helping your consumers understand you and  
become authentic advocates for your products and ideas!


**If you’re one of the spectacular readers who tweet or post about this book to your audience, it’s probably  
because what I’ve written creates a connection that is psychologically consistent with what you believe and  
how you want to present yourself to others. Sharing an idea from this book makes a statement about you,  
just like your choice in jeans, car, or a soft drink. It says, I concur. I am aligned. I think this author is smart,  
and I am smart; therefore, I will share it. This book is cool, and I am cool, so I will share it.  
Your content becomes part of your audience’s personal narrative.**
