# CONTENT MARKETING
What to do if the niche is unsaturated? 
**1. Find an unsaturated niche.  
2. Consistently produce a volume of quality, helpful material aimed at a relevant audience (or persona).  
3. Never stop producing content.**  
Dominating a niche early has extremely important long-term value because the search engines will  
continue to recognize and reward the authority your website accrues for a long time. One pioneering blogger  
told me that after dominating his niche with content for so long, he could probably remain at the top of most  
search engines for years ... even if he never wrote another blog post again.  
**The Content Saturation Index**  
Marcus Sheridan, an entrepreneur and content marketing thought leader, created a theoretical term to  
describe this condition -- “content saturation index.”1 While his social media drug of choice is blogging, his  
experience relates to any content form. He described in a post:  
“The more content an industry/niche has written about it, the harder it is for a blog to make headway  
and find success in that field. And when an industry has very little online content available to the  
masses, it can often be gobbled up within almost no time at all.

## what makes  a great content
I wrote a post about social media audits and published it on my blog. It received no comments or  social activity AT ALL. I later submitted the exact same piece to the Social Media Today website. It  was tweeted hundreds of times and I also had some great responses across the blogosphere.  
So much for great content. It’s the exact same article, but since my blog doesn’t have authority or  community, it wouldn't have been found or read regardless of the quality of my work.  I think at this point the focus has to move from content creation toward the idea of building  community, developing strategies to distribute the content, and marketing to promote every piece.”  
Marcela hit on some more suspicions that point to the elusive Content Code: Regardless of quality, content  marketing success must also include community, distribution, and promotion.  

**The Mirabeau miracle**  
Consider one more example that points to the secrets to content marketing success in an information dense world.  
A few years ago, I was approached by a friendly fellow named Stephen Cronk for help on a new marketing  
strategy. Here’s a summary of his story:  
He left his corporate job in London and moved his family to the Provence region of France.  
In the teeth of a recession and with no previous wine-making experience, he started a new winery called  
Mirabeau.  
He had 600 established competitors—and that was just in Provence!  
This was a tough assignment, but I do love a challenge, and most important, I believed in Stephen. He  
possessed an excellent business mind, an urgency to learn, and a great sense of storytelling. I had to say  
yes!  
Our first step was to determine where he could maneuver in a highly saturated, low-growth market. We  
couldn’t afford to be a “me too.” We conducted a complete market and competitive analysis and discovered  
that among the hundreds of wineries in his region, none of them had a meaningful digital marketing  
presence. At the same time, his potential retail customers were trying to gain a foothold in the social media  
space. In this intersection, we found our opportunity.  
We had to scale a content marketing effort quickly and decided that Stephen’s primary source would be  
video. He was a natural on camera, and the lush and ancient countryside of Provence provided an ideal  
backdrop to explore wine making, food, history, art, and the local color.  
Stephen consistently documented his wine-making journey in a very human and entertaining way. He  
talked about a labeling crisis that almost crushed his business. He created entertaining videos about the  
ridiculous paperwork he faced from the French government, what it was like to attend an international wine-  
tasting competition, and how the grapes were harvested in the early morning sunlight. He created stories  
about his village, his pets, and his family. He shared his anguish as he knelt beside grape vines decimated by  
a 13-minute hail storm. He captured the pure joy of his children dancing while on a family vacation.  
He was putting a human and modern face to a stodgy, traditional business.  
In addition to producing content, we also had a network strategy and continuously worked on building a  
wine-loving audience that was passionate about his product and the stories from his little family business. As  
his audience and engagement multiplied, Stephen was able to share this data with huge wine retailers to  
prove a point of differentiation. No winemaker in the region had the presence and audience that the upstart  
Mirabeau had. The strategy worked, and the orders started coming in.  
Stephen followed our strategy to dominate this unsaturated content niche and his progress was steady.  
But on his 222nd video, Stephen found the gold at the end of the rainbow. In just 29 seconds, he  
demonstrated how to open a wine bottle with only his shoe.6 That video has now attracted well over 9 million  
views ... one of the greatest small business video success stories in the history of the web!  
The viral attention gave a significant lift to all the content on the site. Because Stephen had worked so  
long and hard to provide entertaining videos, the viral visitors stuck around to see what else he had for them.  
Since the “shoe video,” the winery’s “About Mirabeau” video on its YouTube channel has received more than  
10,000 new views. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest accounts, and newsletter subscriptions have had massive  
gains.  
The tiny winery received immense media attention from both the mainstream press and wine industry  
bloggers who marveled at Stephen’s authentic and human storytelling:

## Saturation Guidelines
If there are fewer than 10,000 pages of returned search results, full speed ahead! There’s an opportunity  for you since there is low content density.
Between 10,000 and 100,000 results, expect some resistance, but it’s surmountable with minimal  
investment, exceptional content, and implementation of some of the Content Code factors covered in  
this book.  
If there are between 100,000 and 1 million search results, expect significant resistance. Competing  
through content alone will be difficult. Applying Content Code strategies might be the primary means of  
rising above this level of saturation.  
A result producing more than 1 million pages of content represents a thoroughly saturated niche. Unless  
the content becomes a product in its own right through significant investment, Content Shock exists in  
this niche and is likely to bury even exceptional content creation efforts. In this situation, the Content  
Code strategies would be the only possibility of strategic leverage.  
Examining the relative saturation in your niche is crucial to understanding how the Content Code formula  
will or will not work for your market. It’s extremely difficult to unseat somebody in the search engine ranking  
if they have dominated a niche, even if you’re doing great work. But it’s not hopeless.  
Of course the strategies in this book are going to work well in an environment where the content  
competition is still relatively low. If you’re fortunate enough to already own an unsaturated content niche,  
chances are you’ll dominate the search engine rankings too, and the Content Code will widen the gap  
between you and the laggards.  
However, if you’re behind in your market and you’re feeling like it’s “game over,” the Content Code can  
provide you with an ignition strategy and an entirely new opportunity to maneuver.
